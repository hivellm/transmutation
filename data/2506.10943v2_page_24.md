The gpt-4.1 column reports performance using synthetic data generated by gpt-4.1 with the corresponding prompt format. The v e prompts are shown below. implications Let's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content. Passage: {passage} Implications: implications-long Let's read the following passage and produce a long list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content. Passage: {passage} Implications: implications-very-long Let's read the following passage and produce a very long list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content. Passage: {passage} Implications: implications-chain-o f-thought Let's read the following passage, think step by step, and then produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content. We should rst generate a "Thought Process" and then "Implications" Passage: {passage} Thought Process: 24
