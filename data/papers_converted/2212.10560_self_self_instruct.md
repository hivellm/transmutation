## Abstract

Large “instruction-tuned” language models (i.e., finetuned to respond to instructions) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generalize zero-shot to new tasks. Nevertheless, they depend heavily on human-written instruction data that is often limited in quantity, diversity, and creativity, therefore hindering the generality of the tuned model. We introduce SELF-INSTRUCT, a framework for improving the instruction-following capabilities of pretrained language models by bootstrapping off their own generations. Our pipeline generates instructions, input, and output samples from a language model, then filters invalid or similar ones before using them to finetune the original model. Applying our method to the vanilla GPT3, we demonstrate a 33% absolute improvement over the original model on SUPER-NATURALINSTRUCTIONS, on par with the performance of InstructGPT001,1 which was trained with private user data and human annotations. For further evaluation, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks, and show through human evaluation that tuning GPT3 with SELF-INSTRUCT outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind InstructGPT001. SELF-INSTRUCT provides an almost annotation-free method for aligning pretrained language models with instructions, and we release our large synthetic dataset to facilitate future studies on instruction tuning.2


## 1 Introduction

The recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremendous amount of activity in building models that

text-davinci-001 engine. We focus on this engine since it is the closest to our experimental setup: supervised finetuning with human demonstrations. The newer engines are more powerful, though they use more data (e.g., code completion or latest user queries) or algorithms (e.g., PPO) that are difficult to compare with.

Task LM LM LM🤖 🤖 🤖Figure 2: A high-level overview of SELF-INSTRUCT. The process starts with a small seed set of tasks as the task pool. Random tasks are sampled from the task pool, and used to prompt an off-the-shelf LM to generate both new instructions and corresponding instances, followed by filtering low-quality or similar generations, and then added back to the initial repository of tasks. The resulting data can be used for the instruction tuning of the language model itself later to follow instructions better. Tasks shown in the figure are generated by GPT3.

true variety of tasks and different ways to describe them. Continuing to improve the quality and coverage of instruction-tuned models necessitates the development of alternative approaches for supervising the instruction tuning process. In this work, we introduce SELF-INSTRUCT, a semi-automated process for instruction-tuning a pretrained LM using instructional signals from the model itself. The overall process is an iterative bootstrapping algorithm (see Figure 2), which starts off with a limited (e.g., 175 in our study) seed set of manually-written tasks that are used to guide the overall generation. In the first phase, the model is prompted to generate instructions for new tasks. This step leverages the existing collection of instructions to create more broad-coverage instructions that define (often new) tasks. Given the newlygenerated set of instructions, the framework also creates input-output instances for them, which can be later used for supervising the instruction tuning. Finally, various heuristics are used to automatically filter low-quality or repeated instructions, before adding the remaining valid tasks to the task pool. This process can be repeated for many iterations until reaching a large number of tasks. To evaluate SELF-INSTRUCT empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 (Brown et a l., 2020), which is a vanilla LM (§3). The iterative SELFINSTRUCT process on this model leads to about 52k instructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs and target outputs. We observe that the resulting data provides a diverse range of creative tasks, as is demonstrated by examples in Figure 1. These generated tasks deviate from the distribution of typical NLP tasks, and also have fairly small overlap with the seed tasks (§3.2). On this resulting data, we build GPT3SELF-INST by finetuning GPT3 (i.e., the same model used for generating the instruction data). We evaluate GPT3SELF-INST in comparison to various other models on both typical NLP tasks included in SUPERNI (Wang et a l., 2022), and a set of new instructions that are created for novel usage of instruction-following models (§4). The results indicate that GPT3SELF-INST outperforms GPT3 (the original model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and nearly matches the performance of InstructGPT001. Moreover, our human evaluation on the newlycreated instruction set shows that GPT3SELF-INST demonstrates a broad range of instruction following ability, outperforming models trained on other publicly available instruction datasets and leaving only a 5% gap behind InstructGPT001.

In summary, our contributions are: (1) we introduce SELF-INSTRUCT, a method for inducing instruction following capabilities with minimal human-labeled data; (2) we demonstrate its effectiveness via extensive instruction-tuning experiments; and (3) we release a large synthetic dataset of 52K instructions and a set of manuallywritten novel tasks for building and evaluating future instruction-following models.


## 2 Method

Annotating large-scale instruction data can be challenging for humans because it requires 1) creativity to come up with novel tasks and 2) expertise for writing the solutions to each task. Here, we detail our process for SELF-INSTRUCT, which refers to the pipeline of generating tasks with a vanilla pretrained language model itself, filtering the generated data, and then conducting instruction tuning with this generated data in order to align the LM to follow instructions better. This pipeline is depicted in Figure 2.


## 2.1 Defining Instruction Data

The instruction data we want to generate contains a set of instructions {𝐼𝑡}, each of which defines a task 𝑡 in natural language. Task 𝑡 has 𝑛𝑡 ≥ 1 input-output instances {(𝑋𝑡,𝑖, 𝑌𝑡,𝑖)} 𝑛𝑡 𝑖=1. A model 𝑀 is expected to produce the output, given the task instruction and the corresponding input: 𝑀(𝐼𝑡, 𝑋𝑡,𝑖) = 𝑌𝑡,𝑖, for 𝑖 ∈ {1, … , 𝑛𝑡}. Note that the instruction and instance input does not have a strict boundary in many cases. For example, “write an essay about school safety” can be a valid instruction that we expect models to respond to directly, while it can also be formulated as “write an essay about the following topic” as the instruction, and “school safety” as an instance input. To encourage the diversity of the data format, we allow such instructions that do not require additional input (i.e., 𝑋 is empty).


## 2.2 Automatic Instruction Data Generation

Our pipeline for data generation consists of four steps: 1) generating task instructions, 2) determining if the instruction represents a classification task,


## 3) instance generation with either an input-first o r

output-first approach, and 4) filtering low-quality data.

Instruction Generation. At the first step, SELFINSTRUCT generates new instructions from a small set of seed human-written instructions in a bootstrapping fashion. We initiate the task pool with


## 175 tasks (1 instruction and 1 instance for each

task).3 For every step, we sample 8 task instructions from this pool as i n-context examples. Of the 8 instructions, 6 are from the human-written


## 3These tasks were newly written by the authors and their

labmates at UW, without reference to existing datasets or the test set used in this work. We provide more details about these tasks and analyze their similarity to the test tasks in Appendix §A.1. tasks, and 2 are from the model-generated tasks in previous steps to promote diversity. The prompting template is shown in Table 5.

Classification Task Identification. Because we need two different approaches for classification and non-classification tasks, we next identify whether the generated instruction represents a classification task or not.4 We prompt the LM in a few-shot way to determine this, using 12 classification instructions and 19 non-classification instructions from the seed tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 6.

Instance Generation. Given the instructions and their task type, we generate instances for each instruction independently. This is challenging because it requires the model to understand what the target task i s, based on the instruction, figure out what additional input fields are needed and generate them, and finally complete the task by producing the output. We found that pretrained LMs can achieve this to a large extent when prompted with instruction-input-output i n-context examples from other tasks. A natural way to do this is the Inputfirst Approach, where we can ask an LM to come up with the input fields first based on the instruction, and then produce the corresponding output. This generation order is similar to how models are used to respond to instruction and input, but here with i n-context examples from other tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 7. However, we found that this approach can generate inputs biased toward one label, especially for classification tasks (e.g., for grammar error detection, it usually generates grammatical input). Therefore, we additionally propose an Output-first Approach for classification tasks, where we first generate the possible class labels, and then condition the input generation on each class label. The prompting template is shown in Table 8.5 We apply the outputfirst approach to the classification tasks identified in the former step, and the input-first approach to the remaining non-classification tasks.

Filtering and Postprocessing. To encourage diversity, a new instruction is added to the task pool only when its ROUGE-L similarity with any exist-


## 4More concretely, we regard tasks that have a small limited

output label space as classification tasks.


## 5In this work, we use a fixed set of seed tasks for prompt-

ing the instance generation, and thus only generate a small number of instances per task in one round. Future work can use randomly sampled tasks to prompt the model to generate a larger number of instances in multiple rounds.

ing instruction is less than 0.7. We also exclude instructions that contain some specific keywords (e.g., image, picture, graph) that usually can not be processed by LMs. When generating new instances for each instruction, we filter out instances that are exactly the same or those with the same input but different outputs. Invalid generations are identified and filtered out based on heuristics (e.g., instruction is too long or too short, instance output is a repetition of the input).


## 2.3 Finetuning the LM to Follow Instructions

After creating large-scale instruction data, we use it to finetune the original LM (i.e., SELF-INSTRUCT). To do this, we concatenate the instruction and instance input as a prompt and train the model to generate the instance output in a standard supervised way. To make the model robust to different formats, we use multiple templates to encode the instruction and instance input together. For example, the instruction can be prefixed with “Task:” or not, the input can be prefixed with “Input:” or not, “Output:” can be appended at the end of the prompt or not, and different numbers of break lines can be put in the middle, etc.


## 3 SELF-INSTRUCT Data from GPT3

In this section, we apply our method for inducing instruction data to GPT3 as a case study. We use the largest GPT3 LM (“davinci” engine) accessed through the OpenAI API.6 The parameters for making queries are described in Appendix A.2. Here we present an overview of the generated data.


## 3.1 Statistics

Table 1 describes the basic statistics of the generated data. We generate a total of over 52K instructions and more than 82K instances corresponding to these instructions after filtering.

## 3.2 Diversity

To study what types of instructions are generated and how diverse they are, we identify the verb-noun structure in the generated instructions. We use the Berkeley Neural Parser7 (Kitaev and Klein, 2018; Kitaev et a l., 2019) to parse the instructions and then extract the verb that is closest to the root as well as its first direct noun object. 26,559 out of the


## 52,445 instructions contain such structure; other

instructions usually contain more complex clauses (e.g., “Classify whether this tweet contains political content or not.”) or are framed as questions (e.g., “Which of these statements are true?”). We plot the top 20 most common root verbs and their top 4 direct noun objects in Figure 3, which account for


## 14% of the entire set. Overall, we see quite diverse

intents and textual formats in these instructions.

We further study how the generated instructions differ from the seed instructions used to prompt the generation. For each generated instruction, we compute its highest ROUGE-L overlap with the


## 175 seed instructions. We plot the distribution o f

these ROUGE-L scores in Figure 4. The results indicate a decent number of new instructions were generated, which do not have much overlap with the seeds. We also demonstrate diversity in the length of the instructions, instance inputs, and instance outputs in Figure 5.


## 3.3 Quality

So far, we have shown the quantity and diversity of the generated data, but its quality remains uncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample


## 200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance per

instruction. We asked an expert annotator (author of this work) to label whether each instance is correct or not, in terms of the instruction, the instance input, and the instance output. Evaluation results in Table 2 show that most of the generated instructions are meaningful, while the generated instances may contain more noise (t oa reasonable extent). However, we found that even though the generations may contain errors, most of them are still in the correct format or partially correct, which can provide useful guidance for training models to follow instructions. We listed a number of good examples and bad examples in Table 10 and 11, respectively.

## 4 Experimental Results

We conduct experiments to measure and compare the performance of models under various instruction tuning setups. We first describe our models and other baselines, followed by our experiments.


## 4.1 GPT3SELF-INST: finetuning GPT3 on its

own instruction dataGiven the instruction-generated instruction data, we conduct instruction tuning with the GPT3 model itself (“davinci” engine). As described in §2.3, we use various templates to concatenate the instruction and input, and train the model to generate the output. This finetuning is done through the OpenAI finetuning API.8 We use the default hyper-parameters, except that we set the prompt loss weight to 0, and we train the model for 2 epochs. We refer the reader to Appendix A.3 for additional finetuning details. The resulting model is denoted by GPT3SELF-INST.


## 4.2 Baselines

Off-the-shelf LMs. We evaluate T5-LM (Lester et a l., 2021; Raffel et a l., 2020) and GPT3 (Brown et a l., 2020) as the vanilla LM baselines (only pretraining, no additional finetuning). These baselines will indicate the extent to which off-the-shelf LMs are capable of following instructions naturally immediately after pretraining.

Publicly available instruction-tuned models. T0 and T𝑘-INSTRUCT are two instruction-tuned models proposed in Sanh et a l. (2022) and Wang et a l. (2022), respectively, and are demonstrated to be able to follow instructions for many NLP tasks. Both of these models are finetuned from the T5 (Raffel et a l., 2020) checkpoints and are publicly available.9 For both of these models, we use

their largest version with 11B parameters.

Instruction-tuned GPT3 models. We evaluate InstructGPT (Ouyang et a l., 2022), which is developed by OpenAI based on GPT3 to follow human instructions better and has been found by the community to have impressive zero-shot abilities. There are various generations of these models, where newer ones use more expansive data or algorithmic novelties.10 For our SUPERNI experiments in §4.3, we only compare with their text-davinci-001 engine, because their newer engines are trained with the latest user data and are likely to have already seen the SUPERNI test set. For our human evaluation on newly written instructions, we include their


## 001, 002 and 003 engines for completeness.

Additionally, to compare SELF-INSTRUCT training with other publicly available instruction tuning data, we further finetune GPT3 model with data from PROMPTSOURCE and SUPERNI, which are used to train the T0 and T𝑘-INSTRUCT models. We call them T0 training and SUPERNI training for short, respectively. To save the training budget, we sampled 50K instances (but covering all their instructions) for each dataset, which has a comparable size to the instruction data we generated. Based on the findings from Wang et a l. (2022) and our early experiments, reducing the number of instances per training task does not degrade the model’s generalization performance to unseen tasks.


## 4.3 Experiment 1: Zero-Shot Generalization

o n SUPERNI benchmarkWe first evaluate the models’ ability to follow instructions on typical NLP tasks in a zero-shot fashion. We use the evaluation set of SUPERNI (Wang et a l., 2022), which consists of 119 tasks with 100 instances in each task. In this work, we mainly focus on the zero-shot setup, i.e., the model is prompted with the definition of the tasks only, without incontext demonstration examples. For all our requests to the GPT3 variants, we use the deterministic generation mode (temperature as 0 and no nucleus sampling) without specific stop sequences.

Results. We make the following observations from the results in Table 3. SELF-INSTRUCT boosts the instruction-following ability of GPT3 by a large margin. The vanilla GPT3 model basically cannot follow human instructions at all. Upon manual analysis, we find that it usually generates irrele-

Compared with other models that are not specifically trained for SUPERNI, GPT3SELF-INST achieves better performance than T0 or the GPT3 finetuned on the T0 training set, which takes tremendous human labeling efforts. Notably, GPT3SELF-INST also nearly matches the performance of InstructGPT001, which is trained with private user data and human-annotated labels. Models trained on the SUPERNI training set still achieve better performance on its evaluation set, which we attribute to the similar instruction style and formatting. However, we show that SELFINSTRUCT still brings in additional gains when combined with the SUPERNI training set, proving its value as complementary data.


## 4.4 Experiment 2: Generalization t o

User-oriented Instructions on Novel TasksDespite the comprehensiveness of SUPERNI in collecting existing NLP tasks, most of these NLP tasks were proposed for research purposes and skewed toward classification. To better access the practical value of instruction-following models, a subset of the authors curate a new set of instructions motivated by user-oriented applications. We first brainstorm various domains where large LMs may be useful (e.g., email writing, social media, productivity tools, entertainment, programming), then craft instructions related to each domain along with an input-output instance (again, input is optional). We aim to diversify the styles and formats of these tasks (e.g., instructions may be long or short; inVanilla GPT3GPT3+T0 TrainingGPT3+SuperNI TrainingGPT3 Self-Inst +SuperNI GPT3 Self-Inst InstructGPT 001InstructGPT 002InstructGPT 003187 118 68

put/output may take the form of bullet points, tables, codes, equations, etc.). In total, we create 252 instructions with 1 instance per instruction. We believe it can serve as a testbed for evaluating how instruction-based models handle diverse and unfamiliar instructions. Table 9 presents a small portion of them. The entire set is available in our GitHub repository. We analyze the overlap between this set set and the seed instructions in §A.1.

Human evaluation setup. Evaluating models’ performance on this evaluation set of diverse tasks is extremely challenging because different tasks require different expertise. Indeed, many of these tasks cannot be measured by automatic metrics or even be judged by normal crowdworkers (e.g., writing a program, or converting first-order logic into natural language). To get a more faithful evaluation, we asked the authors of the instructions to judge model predictions. Details on how we set up this human evaluation are described in Appendix B. The evaluators were asked to rate the output based on whether it accurately and effectively completes the task. We implemented a four-level rating system for categorizing the quality of the models’ outputs:

• RATING-A: The response is valid and satisfying. • RATING-B: The response is acceptable but has minor errors or imperfections. • RATING-C: The response is relevant and responds to the instruction, but it has significant errors in the content. For example, GPT3 might generate a valid output first, but continue to generate other irrelevant things. • RATING-D: The response is irrelevant or completely invalid.

Results. Figure 6 shows the performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned counterparts on this newly written instruction set (w. inter-rater agreement 𝜅 = 0.57 on the 4-class categorical scale, see Appendix B for details). As anticipated, the vanilla GPT3 LM is largely unable to respond to instructions, and all instruction-tuned models demonstrate comparatively higher performance. Nonetheless, GPT3SELF-INST (i.e., GPT3 model finetuned with SELF-INSTRUCT) outperforms those counterparts trained on T0 or SUPERNI data by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise. Compared with InstructGPT001, GPT3SELF-INST is quite close in performance—i fw e count acceptable response with minor imperfections (RATING-B) as valid, GPT3SELF-INST is only 5% behind InstructGPT001. Lastly, our evaluation confirms the impressive instruction-following ability of InstructGPT002 and InstructGPT003. Although there are many factors behind this success, we conjecture that future work can largely benefit from improving the quality of our generated data by using human annotators or training a reward model to select better generations, similar to the algorithm used by Ouyang et a l. (2022).


## 4.5 Effect of Data Size and Quality

Data size. SELF-INSTRUCT provides a way to grow instruction data at a low cost with almostno human labeling; could more of this generated data lead to better instruction-following ability? We conduct an analysis of the size of generated data by subsampling different numbers of instructions from the generated dataset, finetuning GPT3 on the sampled subsets, and evaluating how the resulting models perform on the 252 user-oriented instruction set. We conduct the same human evaluation as in §4.4. Figure 7 presents the performance of GPT3SELF-INST models finetuned with different sizes of generated data. Overall, we see consistent improvement as we grow the data size. However, this improvement almost plateaus after 16K. This is inline with the data scaling experiments in Wang et a l. (2022, Fig. 5). Interestingly, when evaluating on SUPERNI we found the model’s performance gain plateaus earlier at around hundreds of instructions. This may be due to the fact that the new generated data is distinct from typical NLP tasks in SUPERNI, indicating that future research may benefit from using a combination of different instruction data for better performance on various types of tasks.

Data quality. Another direction to improve the model’s performance is to take our generated data and get better supervision (with less noise). We explore this idea by using InstructGPT003 (the best available general-purpose model) to regenerate the output field of all our instances given the instruction and input. We then use this improved version of our data to finetune GPT3. This can be regarded as a distillation of InstructGPT003 with our data. As is shown in Figure 7, the resulting model outperforms the counterpart trained with the original data b y

using our generation pipeline to get initial data and then improving the data quality with human experts or distillation from better models.


## 5 Related Work

Instruction-following LMs. A series of works have found evidence that vanilla LMs can be effective at following general language instructions if tuned with annotated “instructional” data—datasets containing language instructional commands and their desired outcomes based on human annotation (Weller et a l., 2020; Mishra et a l., 2022; Wei et a l., 2022; Sanh et a l., 2022, i.a.). Additionally, they show a direct correlation between the size and diversity of the “instructional” data and the generalizability of resulting models to unseen tasks (Wang et a l., 2022; Chung et a l., 2022). However, since 31.0% 36.9%

The smallest size is 175, where only the seed tasks are used for instruction tuning. We also evaluate whether improving the data quality will further improve the performance by distilling the outputs from InstructGPT003. We see consistent improvement from using larger data with better quality.

these developments largely focus on existing NLP tasks and depend on human-annotated instructions, this poses a bottleneck for progress toward more generalizable models (e.g., see Fig. 5a in Wang et a l., 2022). Our work aims to move beyond classical NLP tasks and tackle the challenges of creating diverse instruction data by employing pretrained LMs. InstructGPT (Ouyang et a l., 2022) shares a similar goal as ours in building more generalpurpose LMs, and has demonstrated remarkable performance in following diverse user instructions. However, as a commercial system, their construction process still remains quite opaque. In particular, the role of data has remained understudied due to limited transparency and the private user data they used in their study. Addressing such challenges necessitates the creation of a large-scale, public dataset covering a broad range of tasks.

Language models for data generation and augmentation. A variety of works have proposed using LMs for data generation (Schick and Schütze,


## 2021; Wang et a l., 2021; Liu et a l., 2022; Meng

e ta l., 2023) or augmentation (Feng et a l., 2021; Yang et a l., 2020; Mekala et a l., 2022). Our work differs from this line in that it is not specific to a particular task (say, QA or NLI). In contrast, a distinct motivation for SELF-INSTRUCT is to bootstrap new task definitions that may not have been definedbefore by NLP practitioners (though potentially still important for real users). In parallel with our work, Honovich et a l. (2022a) also propose to generate large-scale instruction data (s o-called Unnatural Instructions) with GPT3 models. The major differences are that 1) they use tasks in SUPERNI (Wang et a l., 2022) as their seed tasks, resulting in a different distribution of generated tasks; 2) they employ InstructGPT002 for generating the data, in which sense they are distilling knowledge from an already instruction-tuned model, while we solely rely on the vanilla LM; 3) the detailed generation pipeline and templates are different. Nevertheless, we believe that both efforts in expanding instruction data are complementary, and the community will benefit from these diverse datasets.

Instruction generation. A series of recent works (Zhou et a l., 2022b; Ye et a l., 2022; Singh et a l., 2022; Honovich et a l., 2022b) generate instructions of a task given a few examples. While SELF-INSTRUCT also involves instruction generation, a major difference in our case is i ti s taskagnostic; we generate new tasks (instructions along with instances) from scratch.

Model self-training. A typical self-training framework (He et a l., 2019; Xie et a l., 2020; Du et a l., 2021; Amini et a l., 2022; Huang et a l., 2022) uses trained models to assign labels to unlabeled data and then leverages the newly labeled data to improve the model. In a similar line, Zhou et a l. (2022a) use multiple prompts to specify a single task and propose to regularize via prompt consistency, encouraging consistent predictions over the prompts. This allows either finetuning the model with extra unlabeled training data, or direct application at inference time. While SELF-INSTRUCT has similarities with the self-training literature, most self-training methods assume a specific target task as well as unlabeled examples under i t; in contrast, SELF-INSTRUCT produces a variety of tasks from scratch.

Knowledge distillation. Knowledge distillation (Hinton et a l., 2015; Sanh et a l., 2019; West et a l., 2021; Magister et a l., 2022) often involves the transfer of knowledge from larger models to smaller ones. SELF-INSTRUCT can also be viewed as a form of “knowledge distillation", however, it differs from this line in the following ways: (1) the source and target of distillation are the same, i.e., a model’s knowledge is distilled to itself; (2) the content of distillation is in the form of an instruction task (i.e., instructions that define a task, and a set of examples that instantiate i t).

Bootstrapping with limited resources. A series of recent works use language models to bootstrap some inferences using specialized methods. NPPrompt (Zhao et a l., 2022) provides a method to generate predictions for semantic labels without any finetuning. It uses a model’s own embeddings to automatically find words relevant to the label of the data sample and hence reduces the dependency on manual mapping from model prediction to label (verbalizers). STAR (Zelikman et a l., 2022) iteratively leverages a small number of rationale examples and a large dataset without rationales, to bootstrap a model’s ability to perform reasoning. Self-Correction (Welleck et a l., 2023) decouples an imperfect base generator (model) from a separate corrector that learns to iteratively correct imperfect generations and demonstrates improvement over the base generator. Our work instead focuses on bootstrapping new tasks in the instruction paradigm.

Multi-modal instruction-following. Instructionfollowing models have also been of interest in the multi-modal learning literature (Fried et a l., 2018; Shridhar et a l., 2020; Min et a l., 2022; Weir et a l.,


## 2022). SELF-INSTRUCT, as a general approach t o

expanding data, can potentially also be helpful in those settings, which we leave to future work.


## 6 Conclusion

We introduce SELF-INSTRUCT, a method to improve the instruction-following ability of LMs via their own generation of instruction data. On experimenting with vanilla GPT3, we automatically construct a large-scale dataset of 52K instructions for diverse tasks, and finetuning GPT3 on this data leads to a 33% absolute improvement on SUPERNI over the original GPT3. Furthermore, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks. Human evaluation on this set shows that tuning GPT3 with SELF-INSTRUCT outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin and performs closely to InstructGPT001. We hope SELF-INSTRUCT can serve as the first step to align pretrained LMs to follow human instructions, and future work can build on top of this data to improve instruction-following models.


## 7 Broader Impact

Beyond the immediate focus of this paper, we believe that SELF-INSTRUCT may help bring more transparency to what happens “behind the scenes” of widely-used instruction-tuned models like InstructGPT or ChatGPT. Unfortunately, such industrial models remain behind API walls as their datasets are not released, and hence there is little understanding of their construction and why they demonstrate impressive capabilities. The burden now falls on academia to better understand the source of success in these models and strive for better—and more open—models. We believe our findings in this paper demonstrate the importance of diverse instruction data, and our large synthetic dataset can be the first step toward higher-quality data for building better instruction-following models. At this writing, the central idea of this paper has been adopted in several follow-u p works for such endeavors (Taori et a l., 2023; Xu et a l., 2023; Sun et a l., 2023, i.a.).


## 8 Limitations

Here, we discuss some limitations of this work to inspire future research in this direction.

Tail phenomena. SELF-INSTRUCT depends on LMs, and it will inherit all the limitations that carry over with LMs. As recent studies have shown (Razeghi et a l., 2022; Kandpal et a l., 2022), tail phenomena pose a serious challenge to the success of LMs. In other words, LMs’ largest gains correspond to the frequent uses of languages (head of the language use distribution), and there might be minimal gains in the low-frequency contexts. Similarly, in the context of this work, it would not be surprising if the majority of the gains by SELFINSTRUCT are skewed toward tasks or instructions that present more frequently in the pretraining corpus. As a consequence, the approach might show brittleness with respect to uncommon and creative instructions.

Dependence on large models. Because of SELFINSTRUCT’s dependence on the inductive biases extracted from LMs, it might work best for larger models. If true, this may create barriers to access for those who may not have large computing resources. We hope future studies will carefully study the gains as a function of model size or various other parameters. It is worthwhile to note that instruction-tuning with human annotation also suffers from a similar limitation: gains of instruction-tuning are higher for larger models (Wei et a l., 2022).

Reinforcing LM biases. A point of concern for the authors is the unintended consequences of this iterative algorithm, such as the amplification of problematic social biases (stereotypes or slurs about gender, race, etc.). Relatedly, one observed challenge in this process is the algorithm’s difficulty in producing balanced labels, which reflected models’ prior biases. We hope future work will lead to better understanding of the pros and cons of the approach.

Supplemental MaterialA Implementation DetailsA.1 Writing the Seed TasksOur method relies on a set of seed tasks to bootstrap the generation. The seed tasks are important for both encouraging the task diversity and demonstrating correct ways for solving the diverse tasks. For example, with coding tasks to prompt the model, it has a larger chance to generate coding-related tasks; i t’s also better to have coding output to guide the model in writing code for new tasks. So, the more diverse the seed tasks are, the more diverse and better quality the generated tasks will b e. Our seed tasks were written when we initiated this project, and targeted for the diverse and interesting usages of LLMs. The tasks were written by the authors and our labmates at UWNLP, without explicit reference to existing datasets or specific testing tasks. We further categorized the tasks into classification and non-classification tasks, based on whether the task has a limited output label space. In total, there are 25 classification tasks and 150 non-classification tasks. We release this data in our GitHub repository.11To provide a sense of how much the model is generalizing beyond these seed tasks, we further quantify the overlap between the instructions of these seed tasks and the instructions of our test sets, including both SUPERNI task instructions (§4.3) and the user-oriented instructions in our human evaluation(§4.4). We compute ROUGE-L similarities between each seed instruction and its most similar instruction in the test set. The distribution of the ROUGE-L scores are plotted in Figure 8, with the average ROUGE-L similarity between the seed instructions and SUPERNI as 0.21, and the average ROUGE-L similarity between the seed instructions and user-oriented instructions as 0.34. We see a decent difference between the seed tasks and both test sets. There is exactly one identical seed instruction occurring in the user-oriented instruction test set, which is “answer the following question” and the following questions are actually very different.

A.2 Querying the GPT3 APIWe use different sets of hyperparameters when querying GPT3 API for different purposes. These hyperparameters are found to work well with the GPT3 model (“davinci” engine) and the other instruction-tuned GPT3 variants. We listed them in Table 4. OpenAI charges $0.02 per 1000 tokens for making completion request to the “davinci” engine as of December, 2022. The generation of our entire dataset cost around $600.

A.3 Finetuning GPT3GPT3SELF-INST and some of our baselines are finetuned from GPT3 model (“davinci” engine with 175B parameters). We conduct this finetuning via OpenAI’s finetuning API.12 While the details of how the model is finetuned with this API are not currently available (e.g., which parameters are updated, or what11https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/human_eval/user_oriented_instructions. jsonl

the optimizer i s), we tune all our models with the default hyperparameters of this API so that the results are comparable. We only set the “prompt_loss_weight” to 0 since we find this works better in our case, and every finetuning experiment is trained for two epochs to avoid overfitting the training tasks. Finetuning is charged based on the number of tokens in the training file. In our case, finetuning GPT3SELF-INST from the GPT3 model on the entire generated data cost $338.

A.4 Prompting Templates for Data GenerationSELF-INSTRUCT relies on a number of prompting templates in order to elicit the generation from language models. Here we provide our four templates for generating the instruction (Table 5), classifying whether an instruction represents a classification task or not (Table 6), generating non-classification instances with the input-first approach (Table 7), and generating classification instances with the output-first approach (Table 8). Come up with a series of tasks:

B Human Evaluation Details for Following the User-oriented InstructionsB.1 Human Evaluation SetupHere we provide more details for the human evaluation described in §4.4 for rating the models’ responses to the 252 user-oriented instructions. To ensure faithful and reliable evaluation, we asked two authors of these instructions (and of this paper) to judge model predictions. These two evaluators coordinated the standards for the 4-level rating system before starting annotation and then each of them rated all the instances independently. They were presented with the instruction, instance input, target output (a sa reference), and model responses. Model responses are listed in random order, with all the model information anonymized. Figure 9 provides a screenshot of the annotation interface. The reported performance in this paper is based on the results from one of the evaluators, and the trends from the other evaluator’s results are the same.

Figure 9: Human evaluation in done using a Google sheet, with predictions from different models present in random order and the model information being anonymized. Our expert evaluators are required to read the instruction and input, refer to the target, and then select the rating for the model’s response from A/B/C/D, corresponding to the 4 levels described in §4.4.

B.2 Human Evaluation AgreementTo measure how reliable our human evaluation i s, we calculate the inner-rater agreement between our two evaluators. We first report Cohen’s 𝜅, which is commonly used to measure inter-rater agreement for categorical items. When calculating this, we treat the 4-level rating (A-D) as a categorical variable, leading to a 𝜅 of 0.58, which is a moderate agreement according to common practice.13 Furthermore, we also calculate the agreement of our evaluators on classifying acceptable responses ((A or B) v s. (C or D)), with a final 𝜅 o f


## 0.75, indicating substantial agreement.

We also compute the Spearman correlation coefficient 𝜌 between the ratings of our two evaluators by treating the rating as an ordinal variable (A>B>C>D). The final coefficient is 𝜌 = 0.81, indicating a high13https://e n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappacorrelation between the two evaluators.

B.3 Example Predictions from GPT3SELF-INST We present a selection of user-oriented tasks, the corresponding GPT3SELF-INST-produced responses and annotator ratings in Table 9. We see that even for responses rated as level C, the model demonstrates extensive steps in solving the task, even though its final output is incorrect.
