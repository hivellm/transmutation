## Abstract

Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. Longformer’s attention mechanism is a drop-i n replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention. Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we evaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-o f-the-art results on text8 and enwik8. In contrast to most prior work, we also pretrain Longformer and ﬁnetune it o na variety of downstream tasks. Our pretrained Longformer consistently outperforms RoBERTa on long document tasks and sets new state-o f-the-art results on WikiHop and TriviaQA. We ﬁnally introduce the Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED), a Longformer variant for supporting long document generative sequence-t o-sequence tasks, and demonstrate its effectiveness on the arXiv summarization dataset. 1

## 1 Introduction

Transformers (Vaswani et a l., 2017) have achieved state-o f-the-art results in a wide range of natural language tasks including generative language modeling (Dai et a l., 2019; Radford et a l., 2019) and discriminative language understanding (Devlin et a l., 2019). This success is partly due to the self-attention component which enables the network to capture contextual information from the entire sequence. While powerful, the memory and computational requirements of self-attention grow

Longformer’s memory usage scales linearly with the sequence length, unlike the full self-attention mechanism that runs out of memory for long sequences on current GPUs. Different implementations vary in speed, with the vectorized Longformer-chunk being the fastest. More details are in section 3.2.

quadratically with sequence length, making it infeasible (o r very expensive) to process long sequences. To address this limitation, we present Longformer, a modiﬁed Transformer architecture with a self-attention operation that scales linearly with the sequence length, making it versatile for processing long documents (Fig 1). This is an advantage for natural language tasks such as long document classiﬁcation, question answering (QA), and coreference resolution, where existing approaches partition or shorten the long context into smaller sequences that fall within the typical 512 token limit of BERT-style pretrained models. Such partitioning could potentially result in loss of important cross-partition information, and to mitigate this problem, existing methods often rely on complex architectures to address such interactions. On the other hand, our proposed Longformer is able to build contextual representations of the entire context using multiple layers of attention, reducing thearXiv:2004.05150v2  [c s.CL]  2 Dec 2020 need for task-speciﬁc architectures. Recent work has addressed the computational inefﬁciency of Transformers on long sequences (see Tab. 1). However, they primarily focus on autoregressive language modeling (LM), while the application of long document transformers to documentlevel NLP tasks in the transfer learning setting (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et a l., 2018; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Devlin et a l., 2019) has remained largely unexplored. We address this gap and show that Longformer’s attention mechanism can act as a drop-i n replacement for the self-attention mechanism in pretrained Transformers, and leads to gains across a suite of document NLP tasks. Longformer’s attention mechanism is a combination of a windowed local-context self-attention and an end task motivated global attention that encodes inductive bias about the task. Through ablations and controlled trials we show both attention types are essential – the local attention is primarily used to build contextual representations, while the global attention allows Longformer to build full sequence representations for prediction. We ﬁrst evaluate Longformer on autoregressive character-level language modeling using a combination of windowed and a new dilated attention pattern, allowing the model to process sequences of u pt o 32K characters on modern GPUs. We achieve state-o f-the-art results on text8 and enwik8 benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of Longformer in long document modeling. Then, to evaluate Longformer’s ability to replace the full self-attention operation of existing pretrained models, we pretrain it with the masked language modeling (MLM) objective, continuing from the RoBERTa (Liu et a l., 2019) released checkpoint. After pretraining, we apply it to downstream language tasks through ﬁnetuning and demonstrate that Longformer consistently outperforms RoBERTa on a wide range of document-level natural language tasks including text classiﬁcation, QA, and coreference resolution, achieving state-ofthe-art results on two of these datasets. We ﬁnally introduce a variant of Longformer which instead of an encoder-only Transformer architecture, it follows an encoder-decoder architecture similar to the original Transformer model (Vaswani et a l., 2017), and it is intended for sequence-t o-sequence (seq2seq) learning (Sutskever et a l., 2014).

## 2 Related Work

Long-Document Transformers Tab. 1 summarizes recent prior work on long documents. Two types of self-attention approaches have been explored. The ﬁrst is a left-t o-right (ltr) approach that processes the document in chunks moving from left-t o-right. While such models have been successful in autoregressive language modeling, they are unsuitable for transfer learning approaches with tasks that beneﬁt from bidirectional context. Our work falls within the other general approach that deﬁnes some form of sparse attention pattern and avoids computing the full quadratic attention matrix multiplication. The model with the most similar attention pattern to ours is Sparse Transformer (Child et a l., 2019), which uses a form of dilated sliding window of blocks of size 8x8 provided by BlockSparse (Gray et a l., 2017). Our implementation (§3) also includes a custom CUDA kernel, but it is more ﬂexible and maintainable than BlockSparse which is implemented in C++, and designed for a speciﬁc version of TensorFlow. We also introduce additional task motivated global attention patterns suitable for common NLP tasks (§3) and show they are essential for good performance in the transfer learning setting. A few models tried tasks other than autoregressive language modeling, which is a step forward because arguably focusing on language modeling as the primary evaluation has led to the development of models with limited applicability.

question answering (QA). However, the evaluation is limited as it doesn’t include language modeling, and the QA datasets are of relatively short documents,2 therefore the effectiveness of this model on long document tasks remains unexplored.

Task-speciﬁc Models for Long Documents Many task-speciﬁc approaches have been developed to workaround the 512 limit of pretrained transformer models like BERT. The simplest approach just truncates the document, commonly used for classiﬁcation (Xie et a l., 2019). Another approach chunks the document into chunks of length 512 (could be overlapping), processes each chunk separately, then combines the activations with a task speciﬁc model (Joshi et a l., 2019). A third approach popular for multihop and open domain QA tasks uses a two-stage model where the ﬁrst stage retrieves relevant documents that are passed onto the second stage for answer extraction (Clark and Gardner, 2017; Chen et a l., 2017). All of these approaches suffer from information loss due to truncation or cascading errors from the two stage approach. In contrast, Longformer can process long sequences without truncating or chunking, allowing us to adopt a much simpler approach that concatenates the available context and processes it i na single pass. A few contemporaneous works3 have explored similar ideas to Longformer using local + global attention in Transformers, and pre-training it for long document natural language tasks. In particular, ETC (Ainslie et a l., 2020) uses a similar local + global attention instead of full self-attention to scale Transformers to long documents. Different from Longformer, ETC uses relative position e m-

beddings (which we only used for the Autoregressive LM setting), introduces an additional training objective (CPC loss) for pre-training, and conﬁgures global attention in a slightly different way. It shows strong results on several tasks including reading comprehension and classiﬁcation. GMAT (Gupta and Berant, 2020) uses a similar idea of few global locations in the input serving as global memory. BigBird (Zaheer et a l., 2020) is an extension over ETC with evaluation on additional tasks, including summarization. Importantly, through theoretical analysis, BigBird shows that sparse Transformers are universal approximators of sequence functions and preserve these properties of the full self-attention.

## 3 Longformer

The original Transformer model has a self-attention component with O( n 2) time and memory complexity where ni s the input sequence length. To address this challenge, we sparsify the full self-attention matrix according to an “attention pattern” specifying pairs of input locations attending to one another. Unlike the full self-attention, our proposed attention pattern scales linearly with the input sequence, making it efﬁcient for longer sequences. This section discusses the design and implementation of this attention pattern.

## 3.1 Attention Pattern

Sliding Window Given the importance of local context (Kovaleva et a l., 2019), our attention pattern employs a ﬁxed-size window attention surrounding each token. Using multiple stacked layers of such windowed attention results in a large receptive ﬁeld, where top layers have access to all input locations and have the capacity to build representations that incorporate information across the entire input, similar to CNNs (Wu et a l., 2019). Given a ﬁxed window size w, each token attends to 1

## 2 w tokens on each side (Fig. 2b). The com-

putation complexity of this pattern is O( n × w),3which scales linearly with input sequence length n. In a transformer with ℓ layers, the receptive ﬁeld size at the top layer is ℓ × w (assuming wi s ﬁxed for all layers). Depending on the application, it might be helpful to use different values of w for each layer to balance between efﬁciency and model representation capacity (§4.1).

Dilated Sliding Window To further increase the receptive ﬁeld without increasing computation, the sliding window can be “dilated”. This is analogous to dilated CNNs (van den Oord et a l., 2016) where the window has gaps of size dilation d (Fig. 2c). Assuming a ﬁxed d and w for all layers, the receptive ﬁeld is ℓ × d × w, which can reach tens of thousands of tokens even for small values of d. In multi-headed attention, each attention head computes a different attention score. We found settings with different dilation conﬁgurations per head improves performance by allowing some heads without dilation to focus on local context, while others with dilation focus on longer context.

Global Attention In state-o f-the-art BERT-style models for natural language tasks, the optimal input representation differs from language modeling and varies by task. For masked language modeling (MLM), the model uses local context to predict the masked word, while for classiﬁcation, the model aggregates the representation of the whole sequence into a special token ([CLS] in case of BERT). For QA, the question and document are concatenated, allowing the model to compare the question with the document through self-attention. In our case, the windowed and dilated attention are not ﬂexible enough to learn task-speciﬁc representations. Accordingly, we add “global attention” on few pre-selected input locations. Importantly, we make this attention operation symmetric: that i s, a token with a global attention attends to all tokens across the sequence, and all tokens in the sequence attend to i t. Fig. 2d shows an example of a sliding window attention with global attention at a few tokens at custom locations. For example for classiﬁcation, global attention is used for the [CLS] token while in QA global attention is provided on all question tokens. Since the number of such tokens is small relative to and independent of n the complexity of the combined local and global attention is still O( n). While specifying global attention is task speciﬁc, it i sa easy way to add inductive bias to the model’s attention, and it is much simpler than existing task speciﬁc approaches that use complex architecture to combine information across smaller input chunks.

Linear Projections for Global Attention Recall that given the linear projections Q, K, V , the Transformer model (Vaswani et a l., 2017) computes attention scores as follows:

Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax ( QKT √d k ) V (1)We use two sets of projections, Qs, Ks, Vs to compute attention scores of sliding window attention, and Qg, Kg, Vg to compute attention scores for the global attention. The additional projections provide ﬂexibility to model the different types of attention, which we show is critical for best performance on downstream tasks. Qg, Kg, Vg are all initialized with values that match Qs, Ks, Vs.

## 3.2 Implementation

In regular transformers, attention scores are computed as in Eqn. 1. The expensive operation is the matrix multiplication QKT because both Q and K have n (sequence length) projections. For Longformer, the dilated sliding window attention computes only a ﬁxed number of the diagonals of QKT . As shown in Fig. 1, this results in a linear increase in memory usage compared to quadratic increase for full self-attention. However, implementing it requires a form of banded matrix multiplication that is not supported in existing deep learning libraries like PyTorch/Tensorﬂow. Fig. 1 compares the performance of three different ways of implementing i t: loop is a memory efﬁcient PyTorch implementation that supports dilation but is unusably slow and only used for testing; chunks only supports the non-dilated case and is used for the pretraining/ﬁnetuning setting; and cuda is our fully functioning highly optimized custom CUDA kernel implemented using TVM (Chen et a l., 2018) and used for the language modeling experiments (see Appendix A for more details).

## 4 Autoregressive Language Modeling

Autoregressive or left-t o-right language modeling is loosely deﬁned as estimating the probability distribution of an existing token/character given its previous tokens/characters in an input sequence. This task is considered one of the fundamental tasks in natural language and recent prior work on modeling long sequences using transformers has relied4on this task as their primary evaluation (Dai et a l.,

## 2019; Rae et a l., 2020; Sukhbaatar et a l., 2019).

Similarly, we develop and evaluate our model on autoregressive language modeling.

## 4.1 Attention Pattern

For autoregressive language modeling we use our dilated sliding window attention. Following Sukhbaatar et a l. (2019) we use differing window sizes across the layers. In particular, we use small window sizes for the lower layers and increase window sizes as we move to higher layers. This allows the top layers to learn higher-level representation of the entire sequence while having the lower layers capture local information. In addition, it provides balance between efﬁciency (smaller window sizes are less computationally expensive due to fewer nonzero values) and performance (larger window sizes have richer representation power and often result in performance improvements). We do not use dilated sliding windows for lower layers to maximize their capacity to learn and utilize the immediate local context. For the higher layers, we use a small amount of increasing dilation only on 2 heads. This gives the model the ability to directly attend to distant tokens without sacriﬁcing local context.

## 4.2 Experiment Setup

To compare to prior work we focus on characterlevel LM (text8 and enwik8; Mahoney, 2009).

Training Ideally, we would like to train our model on the largest window size and sequence length we can ﬁt in a modern GPU memory. However, we found that the model needs a large number of gradient updates to learn the local context ﬁrst, before learning to utilize longer context. To accommodate this, we adopt a staged training procedure where we increase the attention window size and sequence length across multiple training phases. In particular, in the ﬁrst phase we start with a short sequence length and window size, then on each subsequent phase, we double the window size and the sequence length, and halve the learning rate. This makes training fast, while keeping the slow part (longest sequences and window sizes) to the end. We train the model over 5 total phases with starting sequence length of 2,048 and ending sequence length of 23,040 on the last phase (see Appendix B for detailed conﬁgurations of each phase, and for all other hyperparameters).

## 4.2.1 Results

Tab. 2 and 3 summarize evaluation results on text8 and enwik8 datasets. We achieve a new state-o f-the-art on both text8 and enwik8 using the small models with BPC of 1.10 and 1.00 on text8 and enwik8 respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model.

For large models, given how expensive these experiments are, and following recent work (Kitaev et a l., 2020; Rae et a l., 2020), we are only evaluating on enwik8. Tab. 3 shows that Longformer outperforms the comparable TransformerXL model, matches the performance of the comparable Sparse Transformer (Child et a l., 2019), and matches or slightly underperforms recent models that have more than twice the number of parameters. It is worth noting that Adaptive Span (Sukhbaatar et a l., 2019) and Compressive Transformer (Rae et a l., 2020) are not good ﬁt for the pretrainingﬁnetuning paradigm as discussed in §2.

## 4.2.2 Ablation Study

To show the importance of the design choices of our attention patterns, we tried different variants and report their controlled experiment results. To make the ablation study more manageable, we train each conﬁguration for 150K steps4 with phase 1 conﬁguration on a small model on text8, then report the BPC performance on the dev set. The top of Tab. 4 demonstrates the impact of different ways of conﬁguring the window sizes per layer. We observe that increasing the window size from the bottom to the top layer leads to the best performance, arranging them in the reverse way leads to worse performance, and using a ﬁxed window size (the average of window sizes of the other conﬁguration) leads to a performance that it i si n between. The bottom of Tab. 4 shows the impact of adding dilation. Adding some dilation to two heads leads to some improvement compared with no dilation at all.

## 5 Pretraining and Finetuning

Current state-o f-the-art systems for many NLP tasks ﬁnetune a pretrained model with task supervision (e.g. BERT). One of our main motivations is to develop such a model suitable for long document tasks. To do s o, we pretrained Longformer on a document corpus and ﬁnetune it for six tasks, including classiﬁcation, QA and coreference resolution. The resulting model can process sequences up to 4,096 tokens long (8 times longer than BERT)5. We pretrain Longformer with masked language modeling (MLM), where the goal is to recover randomly masked tokens in a sequence. Since MLM pretraining is expensive, we continue pretraining from the RoBERTa (Liu et a l., 2019) released checkpoint, while only making the minimal

not agree with that at step 150K. However, this approximation saves the huge cost of running every experiment to completion.

changes necessary to support Longformer’s attention mechanism. Note that our attention pattern can be plugged into any pretrained transformer model without the need to change the model architecture.

Attention Pattern We use sliding window attention with window size of 512, therefore using the same amount of computation as RoBERTa.6Position Embeddings RoBERTa uses learned absolute position embeddings with the maximum position being 512. To support longer documents, we add extra position embeddings to support up to position 4,096. To leverage RoBERTa’s pretrained weights, instead of randomly initializing the new position embeddings, we initialize them by copying the 512 position embeddings from RoBERTa multiple times as analysis of BERT’s attention heads shows a strong learned bias to attending to local context, including the previous or next token (Clark et a l., 2019). Using the copy initialization preserves this local structure everywhere except at the partition boundaries. Despite its simplicity, we found this to b ea very effective (see Tab. 5), allowing Longformer pretraining to rapidly converge with a small number of gradient updates.

Continued MLM Pretraining We pretrain Longformer using fairseq (Ott et a l., 2019) on a corpus of long documents that we compiled (see Appendix C for corpus details). We train two model sizes, a base model and a large model. Both models are trained for 65K gradient updates with sequences length 4,096, batch size 64 (218 tokens), maximum learning rate of 3e-5, linear warmup of 500 steps, followed by a power 3 polynomial decay. The rest of the hyperparameters are the same as RoBERTa. Tab. 5 shows the BPC on the development set of our training corpus. The ﬁrst row shows a 1.846

The following two rows show the performance of Longformer before pretraining with randomly initialized position embeddings and with copied position embeddings. The signiﬁcant difference indicates the importance of the copy initialization, and the relative small difference between the RoBERTa BPC and the initialized BPC indicates that our sliding window attention is working well with the RoBERTa weights.

Frozen RoBERTa Weights We also pretrained Longformer while freezing all RoBERTa weights, and only training the new position embeddings. The motivation for this conﬁguration is to perfectly preserve the RoBERTa performance on short documents. This conﬁguration has a BPC of 1.850 (down from 1.957 at initialization), but higher than

## 1.705 where all the weights are trainable.

## 6 Tasks

We apply Longformer to multiple long document tasks, including QA, coreference resolution and classiﬁcation. Tab. 6 shows the evaluation datasets have contexts signiﬁcantly longer than 512 wordpieces. Our primary goal is to evaluate whether our attention mechanism can act as a replacement for the standard self-attention mechanism in BERT style models, and to perform controlled trials against a strong baseline. We are also interested in evaluating whether we can replace complicated task speciﬁc models necessitated by BERT’s limited context with simpler models that just concatenate all available context into a single sequence. Our baseline is a RoBERTa based model that breaks the context into the longest possible segment, passes each individually through RoBERTa, and concatenates the activations for further processing. For QA tasks, we also concatenate the question to each segment so that RoBERTa can condition i t’s contextual representations of the context on the question. The Longformer variant replaces the RoBERTa self-attention mechanism with our windowed attention used during pretraining, plus a task motivated global attention. The global attention uses additional linear projections (§3.1).

## 6.1 Question answering

We used three datasets: WikiHop (Welbl et a l.,

## 2018), TriviaQA (Joshi et a l., 2017, Wikipedia set-

ting), and HotpotQA, (Yang et a l., 2018, distractor setting).7For WikiHop and TriviaQA we follow the simple QA model of BERT (Devlin et a l., 2019), and concatenate question and documents into one long sequence, run it through Longformer, then have a dataset-speciﬁc prediction layer. WikiHop uses a classiﬁcation layer for the candidate while TriviaQA uses the loss function of Clark and Gardner (2017) to predict answer span. We include global attention to question tokens and answer candidates for WikiHop and to question tokens for TriviaQA. HotpotQA is a multihop QA dataset that involves extracting answer spans and evidence sentences from 10 Wikipedia paragraphs, 2 of which are relevant and the rest are distractors. We use a two-stage model that ﬁrst selects the most relevant paragraphs then passes them to a second stage for answer extraction. Both stages concatenate question and context into one sequence, run it through Longformer, then use task-speciﬁc prediction layers. We train the models in a multi-task way to predict relevant paragraphs, evidence sentences, answer spans and question types (yes/n o/span) jointly. Note that this model is simpler than recent SOTA models that include complex task-speciﬁc architectures (e.g., (Tu et a l., 2019; Chen et a l., 2019; Tu et a l., 2020; Groeneveld et a l., 2020)). See Appendix D for further details about the models and hyperparameters.

the system from Lee et a l. (2018) to replace ELMo with BERT. The Longformer system is a straightforward adaption of the baseline model by replacing RoBERTa with Longformer and extending the sequence length. We didn’t use global attention for this task.

## 6.3 Document Classiﬁcation

We evaluate on IMDB (Maas et a l., 2011) and Hyperpartisan news detection (Kiesel et a l., 2019) datasets.8 IMDB is a standard sentiment classiﬁcation datasets consisting of movie reviews. While most documents in this dataset are short, about

## 13.6% of them are larger than 512 wordpieces

(Tab. 6). Documents in Hyperpartisan are relatively long, and it is small with only 645 documents making it a good test for Longformer’s ability to adapt to limited data. We use global attention on the [CLS] token.

## 6.4 Results

Main Result Tab. 7 summarizes the results of all our ﬁnetuning experiments. We observe that Longformer consistently outperforms the RoBERTa baseline. Its performance gain is especially obvious for tasks that require long context such as WikiHop and Hyperpartisan. For TriviaQA, the improvement is more modest as the local context is often sufﬁcient to answer the question. In the case of HotpotQA, the supporting fact auxiliary supervision allows models to easily ﬁnd relevant contexts and then focus on local context, leading to smaller gains. This is contrasted with WikiHop that only includes distant supervision of intermediate reasoning chains, where our approach excels by reasoning over the entire context. On the IMDB and OntoNotes datasets the performance gains are smaller. For IMDB, the majority of the dataset consists of short documents and thus it is expected to see smaller improvements.

found that the distance between any two mentions is typically quite small so that a baseline that processes smaller chunks separately is able to stitch together mentions into coreference chains without considering cross chunk interactions.

Longformer-large for QA We also evaluate the performance of Longformer-large on long context QA tasks. Tab. 8 shows that our Longformer-large achieves new state-o f-the-art results9 on WikiHop and TriviaQA by large margins (3.6 and 4 points respectively), and for HotpotQA, it underperforms the current state-o f-the-art (Fang et a l., 2020) by a point. Tab. 9 shows the detailed results of HotpotQA compared with published and unpublished concurrent models. Longformer places second on the published leaderboard, outperforming all other published results except for HGN (Fang et a l.,

this task (Tu et a l., 2019; Fang et a l., 2020; Shao et a l., 2020) use GNNs (Kipf and Welling, 2017) or graph network of entities, which seem to encode an important inductive bias for the task and can potentially improve our results further. Nevertheless, Longformer performs strongly outperforming all other methods including the recent non-GNN methods (Glaß et a l., 2019; Shao et a l., 2020; Groeneveld et a l., 2020).

## 6.5 Ablations on WikiHop

Tab. 10 presents an ablation study for WikiHop on the development set. All results use Longformerbase, ﬁne-tuned for ﬁve epochs with identical hyperparameters except where noted. Longformer beneﬁts from longer sequences, global attention, separate projection matrices for global attention, MLM pretraining, and longer training. In addition, when conﬁgured as in RoBERTa-base (seqlen: 512, and n 2 attention) Longformer performs slightly worse then RoBERTa-base, conﬁrming that performance gains are not due to additional pretraining. Performance drops slightly when using the RoBERTa model pretrained when only unfreezing the additional position embeddings, showing that Longformer can learn to use long range context in task speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning with large training datasets such as WikiHop.

## 9At submission time, May 2020. Later, BigBird (Zaheer

e ta l., 2020) improved leaderboard results on these datasets. There are confounding factors such as using 16X more compute in BigBird’s pretraining compared with Longformer, potentially affecting the performance.

## 7 Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED)

The original Transformer (Vaswani et a l., 2017) consisted of an encoder-decoder architecture, intended for sequence-t o-sequence tasks (Sutskever et a l., 2014), such as summarization and translation. While encoder-only Transformers are effective on a variety of NLP tasks, pre-trained encoderdecoder Transformer models (e.g. BART (Lewis et a l., 2020) and T5 (Raffel et a l., 2020)) have achieved strong results on tasks like summarization. Yet, such models can’t efﬁciently scale to seq2seq tasks with longer inputs. To facilitate modeling long sequences for seq2seq learning, we propose a Longformer variant that has both the encoder and decoder Transformer stacks but instead of the full self-attention in the encoder, it uses the efﬁcient local+global attention pattern of the Longformer. The decoder uses the full self-attention to the entire encoded tokens and to previously decoded locations. We call this model Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED) which scales linearly with the input. Since pre-training LED is expensive, we initialize LED parameters from the BART, and follow BART’s exact architecture in terms of number of layers and hidden sizes. The only difference is that to process longer inputs, we extend position embedding to 16K tokens (u p from BART’s 1K tokens) and we initialize the new position embedding matrix by repeatedly copying BART’s 1K position embeddings 16 times as in Section 5 for RoBERTa. Following BART, we release two model sizes, LED-base and LED-large, which respectively have 6 and 12 layers in both encoder and decoder stacks. We evaluate LED on the summarization task using the arXiv summarization dataset (Cohan et a l.,

## 2018) which focuses on long document summariza-

tion in the scientiﬁc domain. The 90th percentile of document lengths is 14.5K tokens, making it an appropriate testbed for evaluating LED. LED’s encoder reads the document and its decoder generates the output summary. The encoder uses local attention with window size 1,024 tokens and global attention on the ﬁrst <s> token. The decoder uses full attention to the entire encoder and previously decoded locations. As standard in seq2seq models, LED is trained using teacher forcing on gold training summaries and uses beam search at inference. Tab. 11 demonstrates the results of LED-large

pre-training. We observe that LED achieves stateof-the-art results on arXiv, slightly outperforming BigBird (Zaheer et a l., 2020). Note that the BigBird summarization model supports sequence length of 4K tokens but starts from and continues pre-training Pegasus (Zhang et a l., 2020), a model speciﬁcally designed and pre-trained for summarization. With no pre-training or task-speciﬁc initialization, but with ability to process longer inputs, LED can slightly outperform BigBird. Further improvements should be possible through pre-training of LED. Fig. 3 further illustrates the importance of sequence length showing the ablility to process longer input signiﬁcantly improves the results.

## 8 Conclusion and Future Work

We present Longformer, a transformer-based model that is scalable for processing long documents and that makes it easy to perform a wide range of document-level NLP tasks without chunking/shortening the long input and without complex architecture to combine information across these chunks. Longformer employs an attention pattern that combines local and global information while also scaling linearly with the sequence length. Longformer achieves state-o f-the-art results on the character-level language modeling tasks of text8 and enwik8. When pretrained, Longformer consistently outperforms RoBERTa on long document tasks and sets new state-o f-the-art results on WikiHop and TriviaQA. We further present LED, an encoder-decoder variant of Longformer for modeling sequence-t o-sequence tasks, and achieve stateof-the-art results on the arXiv long document summarization task. For future work, we would like to study other pretraining objectives, especially for LED, increase the sequence length, and explore other tasks that might beneﬁt from our model.

12A Implementation DetailsImplementing Longformer’s dilated sliding window attention requires a form of banded matrix multiplication (matrix multiplication where the output is all zero except certain diagonals) that is not directly supported in existing deep learning libraries like PyTorch/Tensorﬂow. Fig. 1 compares the runtime and memory of three different ways of implementing i t. Longformer-loop is a naive implementation that computes each diagonal separately in a loop. It is memory efﬁcient because it only computes the non-zero values, but it is unusably slow. We only use it for testing because it is easy to implement but don’t use it to run experiments. Longformer-chunks only supports the nondilated case. It chunks Q and K into overlapping blocks of size w and overlap of size 1

## 2 w, multiplies

the blocks, then mask out the diagonals. This is very compute efﬁcient because it uses a single matrix multiplication operation from PyTorch, but it consumes 2x the amount of memory a perfectly optimized implementation should consume because it computes some of the zero values. Because of the compute efﬁciency, this implementation is most suitable for the pretrain/ﬁnetune case. We didn’t ﬁnd the increase in memory to b ea problem for this setting. Longformer-cuda is a custom CUDA kernel that we implement using TVM (Chen et a l., 2018). It is a fully functioning implementation of our attention (not limited as Longformer-chunks), it is the most memory efﬁcient, and it i sa s fast as the highly optimized full self-attention.10 We mainly use this implementation for the autoregressive language modeling experiments because of the memory efﬁciency (allows the longest sequences) and the support of dilation (needed for characterLM experiments).

Tensor Virtual Machine (TVM) We build our custom CUDA kernel using TVM (Chen et a l.,

## 2018), a deep learning compiler stack that compiles

high level description of a function into optimized device-speciﬁc code. Using TVM, we describe our banded matrix multiplication in high-level python

Longformer-cuda should be faster than the n

tion. However, achieving this level of performance requires special knowledge of low-level GPU programming, similar to implementing a highly optimized matrix multiplication. Our current implementation is sufﬁciently fast and practical to use. constructs, then TVM generates the corresponding CUDA code and compiles it for GPUs.

B Character LM HyperparametersWe evaluate on text8 and enwik8, both contain

## 100M characters from Wikipedia split into 90M,

## 5M, 5M for train, dev, test. Our model only speci-

ﬁes how the self-attention component works, and it is agnostic to the other design choices for the transformer model. Our implementation is based on the Transformer-XL (Dai et a l., 2019) code11 with the memory mechanism disabled. We use relative position embeddings with sinusoidal weights as in Dai et a l. (2019). We use two different model sizes, a small (12 layers, 512 hidden size) model as in Dai et a l. (2019), and a large (30 layers, 512 hidden size) model as in Child et a l. (2019). We employed mixed precision training (ﬂoating points 16 and 32) using apex12 to reduce memory consumption and speed-u p training. However, we kept the attention computation in fp32 to avoid numerical instability issues.13 We used gradient checkpointing (Chen et a l., 2016) to reduce memory usage, and ran our experiments on 48GB RTX8000 GPUs. All hyperparameters and stage conﬁgurations are listed in Tab. 12. Our CUDA kernel supports the autoregressive mode where each token attends to a window of previous tokens only. Our implementation also includes a version of the relative position embedding that is compatible with our dilated sliding window attention. We ran the small model experiments on 4 RTX8000 GPUs for 16 days. For the large model, we ran experiments on 8 RTX8000 GPUs for 13 days. Most of our hyperparameter search is similar to the ablation in Tab. 4 where we run the conﬁguration for 150K steps on text8. We experimented with absolute position embeddings and learned position embeddings, dropout values of [0.1, 0.2] (small model) and [0.1, 0.4] (large model), prelayernorm and post-layernorm (Xiong et a l., 2020), learning rate (LR) of phase1 of values [2.5e-5, 5e-

C Pretraining DataIn order to allow the model to learn long dependencies in pretraining, we compiled a corpus of long documents. Some of these data sources were also included in the original RoBERTa pretraining including the Books corpus (Zhu et a l., 2015) plus English Wikipedia. We additionally included one third of a subset of the Realnews dataset (Zellers et a l., 2019) with documents longer than 1,200 tokens as well as one third of the Stories (Trinh and Le, 2018) corpus. Our goal was to include a mix of long and short documents to both allow the model to learn longer dependencies while not to forget information from the original RoBERTa pretraining. The statistics of the pretraining data is shown in Tab. 13.

D Task speciﬁc model detailsAll the QA and classiﬁcation models are implemented using PyTorch-Lightning14. We use the ofﬁcial train/dev/test splits of all datasets except for the Hyperpartisan news which we randomely split into 80/10/10 for train/dev/test.

WikiHop Instances in WikiHop consist o f: a question, answer candidates (ranging from two candidates to 79 candidates), supporting contexts (ranging from three paragraphs to 63 paragraphs), and the correct answer. The dataset does not provide any intermediate annotation for the multihop reasoning chains, requiring models to instead infer them from the indirect answer supervision. To prepare the data for input to Longformer and RoBERTa, we ﬁrst tokenize the question, answer candidates, and support contexts using RoBERTa’s wordpiece tokenizer. Then we concatenate the question and answer candidates with special tokens as [q] question [/q] [ent] candidate1 [/ent] ... [ent] candidateN [/ent]. The contexts are also concatenated using RoBERTa’s document delimiter tokens as separators: </s> context1 </s> ... </s> contextM </s>. The special tokens [q], [/q], [ent], [/ent] were added to the RoBERTa vocabulary and randomly initialized before task ﬁnetuning.

14https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/ pytorch-lightning After preparing the input data, we compute activations from the top layer of each model as follows. We take the question and answer candidates and concatenate them to as much context as possible up to the model sequence length (512 for RoBERTa,

## 4,096 for Longformer), run the sequence through

the model, collect the output activations, and repeat until all of the context is exhausted (for all models except Longformer-large, where we just include the ﬁrst 4,096 length sequence due to memory requirements). Then all activations for all chunks are concatenated into one long sequence. In the case of Longformer, we use global attention to the entire question and answer candidate sequence. For prediction, we attach a linear layer to each [ent] that outputs a single logit, average over all logits for each candidate across the chunks, apply a softmax and use the cross entropy loss with the correct answer candidate. Training used the Adam optimizer with linear warmup over 200 gradient updates to a maximum LR, and linear decay over the remainder of training. We used gradient accumulation to effective batch size of 32 instances, checking the development accuracy every 250 gradient updates and reported the maximum development accuracy. Other hyperparameters (dropout, weight decay) were identical to RoBERTa pretraining. In general, we ran minimal hyperparameter trials, but for fair comparison between Longformer and RoBERTa ran an identical hyperparameter search with Longformer-base and RoBERTa-base. This consisted of a grid search of LR in [2e-5, 3e-5,

## 5e-5] and number epochs in [5, 10, 15]. The

## 15 epochs. We ran two hyperparameter trials for

Longformer-large, l r=3e-5 and number epochs in [5, 15] (the 5 epoch model had higher dev accuracy of 77.6, and was the single model submitted to the public leaderboard for test set evaluation). All models were trained on a single RTX8000 GPU, with Longformer-base taking about a day for 5 epochs.

TriviaQA TriviaQA has more than 100K question, answer, document triplets for training. Documents are Wikipedia articles, and answers are named entities mentioned in the article. The span that answers the question is not annotated, but it is found using simple text matching.

wards, we get the activations from RoBERTa and Longformer similar to WikiHop (discussed above). We use global attention on all question tokens.

For prediction, we add one layer that predicts the beginning and end of the answer span. Because of the distant supervision nature of the training data (n o gold answer spans), we use the loss function of Clark and Gardner (2017) which works like an OR that the model only needs to get one answer span right, not all of them. Hyperparameters of the best conﬁguration are listed in Tab. 14. All other hyperparameters are similar to RoBERTa’s. For hyperparameter search, we only tuned LR for the RoBERTa baseline and tried rates [3e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4], then used the best, which is 3e-5, for all subsequent experiments with no further tuning. We trained the Longformer-large with the best conﬁguration once and submitted its output to the leaderboard. We ran our experiments on 32GB V100 GPUs.

HotpotQA HotpotQA dataset involves answering questions from a set of 10 paragraphs from

## 10 different Wikipedia articles where 2 paragraphs

are relevant to the question and the rest are distractors. It includes 2 tasks of answer span extraction and evidence sentence identiﬁcation. Our model for HotpotQA combines both answer span extraction and evidence extraction in one joint model. We found a higher performance using a two-stage Longformer model with similar setup that ﬁrst identiﬁes relevant paragraphs and then does ﬁnd the ﬁnal answer span and evidence.15This is largely because removing the distracting paragraphs ﬁrst reduces the noise for the ﬁnal evidence and span detection as also found to be important by recent state-o f-the-art methods in this dataset (Fang et a l., 2020). Similar to Wikihop and TriviaQA, to prepare the data for input to Longformer, we concatenate question and then all the

## 10 paragraphs in one long context. We particu-

larly use the following input format with special tokens: “[CLS] [q] question [/q] ⟨t⟩ title1 ⟨/t⟩ sent1,1 [s] sent1,2 [s] ...

## 15The ﬁnal dev performance of the two stage model i m-

proves over a single stage model by about 4.2 points on jointF1 metric15⟨t⟩ title2 ⟨/t⟩ sent2,1 [s] sent2,2 [s] ...” where [q], [/q], ⟨t⟩, ⟨/t⟩, [s], [p] are special tokens representing, question start and end, paragraph title start and end, and sentence, respectively. The special tokens were added to the Longformer vocabulary and randomly initialized before task ﬁnetuning. For Longformer, we use global attention to question tokens, paragraph title start tokens as well as sentence tokens. The model includes additional feedforward layers on top of paragraph title start tokens for prediction of relevant paragraphs, as well as sentence tokens for predicting evidence sentences. After training the ﬁrst stage model, we predict relevant paragraph scores for both training and development set. We then keep up to 5 paragraphs whose raw score is higher than a pre-speciﬁed threshold (-3.0), and remove the other paragraphs from the context. We then train the second stage model on the resulting shortened context. For answer span extraction we use BERT’s QA model (Devlin et a l., 2019) with addition of a question type (yes/n o/span) classiﬁcation head over the ﬁrst special token ([CLS]). For evidence extraction we apply 2 layer feedforward networks on top of the representations corresponding to sentence and paragraph tokens to get the corresponding evidence prediction scores and use binary cross entropy loss to train the model. At inference time for evidence extraction, we use a constrained decoding strategy similar to Groeneveld et a l. (2020) that ensures that the evidence sentences come from exactly two paragraphs which is the setup of this dataset. We combine span, question classiﬁcation, sentence, and paragraphs losses and train the model in a multitask way using linear combination of losses. Our experiments are done on RTX8000 GPUs and training each epoch takes approximately half a day on 4 GPUs. We trained the model using Adam optimizer with linear warmup (1000 steps) and linear decay. We used minimal hyperparameter tuning using LRs of 3e-5 and 5e-5 and epochs of 3 to 7 and found the model with LR of 3e-5 and 5 epochs to work best. We conduct the same hyperparameter search for the RoBERTa baseline as well. The rest of hyperparameters are reported in Tab 14.

Coreference model details The coreference model is a straightforward adaptation of the coarseto-ﬁne BERT based model from Joshi et a l. (2019).

document into non-overlapping segments up to the maximum sequence length, then concatenates the activations for the coarse-t o-ﬁne clustering stage that forms coreference clusters. The maximum sequence length was 384 for RoBERTa-base, chosen after three trials from [256, 384, 512] using the default hyperparameters in the original implementation.16 For Longformer-base the sequence length was 4,096. Similar to the original implementation, different learning rates were used for the pretrained RoBERTa parameters and the randomly initialized task parameters. Using a larger learning rate in the task parameters allows the optimizer to adjust them farther from their randomly initialized values without destroying the information in the pretrained RoBERTa parameters. Hyperparameter searches were minimal and consisted of grid searches of RoBERTa LR in [1e-5,

## 2e-5, 3e-5] and task LR in [1e-4, 2e-4, 3e-4] for

both RoBERTa and Longformer for a fair comparison. The best conﬁguration for Longformer-base was RoBERTa l r=1e-5, task l r=1e-4. All other hyperparameters were the same as in the original implementation. Training takes about 10 hours on a single GPU. Our implementation is a superhack that involves PyTorch and Tensorﬂow sharing a single process and GPU. To avoid r e-implementing the complicated coarse-t o-ﬁne logic from Tensorﬂow in PyTorch (that involves a highly optimized custom GPU kernel originally released by Lee et a l. (2018)), we devised a system where the lower transformer portion of the model passes activations and gradients back and forth between PyTorch and Tensorﬂow. The input tensors are ﬁrst run through the transformer in PyTorch, the activations are collected from the top layer, transferred from GPU to CPU then from CPU to Tensorﬂow and back to GPU to run the coarse-t o-ﬁne clustering and compute the loss. Then gradients are back propogated16https://github.com/mandarjoshi90/coref16in Tensorﬂow to the top of the transformer and the process reversed to transfer them to PyTorch for back propogation through the remainder of the model. Separate optimizers are maintained with identical LR schedules for parameter updates. The overhead in this approach is minimal compared to the overall cost of running the model.

Text classiﬁcation For classiﬁcation, following BERT, we used a simple binary cross entropy loss on top of a ﬁrst [CLS] token with addition of global attention to [CLS]. We used Adam optimizer with batch sizes of 32 and linear warmup and decay with warmup steps equal to 0.1 of the total training steps. For both IMDB and Hyperpartisan news we did grid search of LRs [3e-5, 5e-5] and epochs [10, 15, 20] and found the model with [3e-5] and epochs 15 to work best. Experiments were done on a single RTX8000 GPU. 17
