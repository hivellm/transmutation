## MEASURING MASSIVE MULTITASK

LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDINGDan Hendrycks UC Berkeley Collin Burns Columbia University Steven Basart UChicago Andy Zou UC BerkeleyMantas Mazeika UIUC Dawn Song UC Berkeley Jacob Steinhardt UC BerkeleyABSTRACTWe propose a new test to measure a text model’s multitask accuracy. The test covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability. We ﬁnd that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have nearrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model’s academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of recently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance for language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the actual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark (GLUE) (Wang et a l., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings of GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difﬁcult tasks (Wang et a l.,

## 2019). About a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level

(Raffel et a l., 2019). While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language understanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning and everyday knowledge (Zellers et a l., 2019; Huang et a l., 2019; Bisk et a l., 2019). However, these recent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et a l., 2020). Overall, the near human-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets of language understanding.

Transformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including all of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites. These models consequently see extensive information about specialized topics, most of which is not assessed by existing NLP benchmarks. It consequently remains an open question just how capable current language models are at learning and applying knowledge from many domains.

To bridge the gap between the wide-ranging knowledge that models see during pretraining and the existing measures of success, we introduce a new benchmark for assessing models across a diverse set of subjects that humans learn. We design the benchmark to measure knowledge acquired during pretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This makes the benchmark more challenging and more similar to how we evaluate humans. The benchmark covers 57 subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. It ranges in difﬁculty from an elementary level to an advanced professional level, and it tests both world knowledge and problem solving ability. Subjects range from traditional areas, such as mathematics and history, to more

specialized areas like law and ethics (Hendrycks et a l., 2020). The granularity and breadth of the subjects makes the benchmark ideal for identifying a model’s blind spots.

We ﬁnd that meaningful progress on our benchmark has only become possible in recent months. In particular, few-shot models up to 13 billion parameters (Brown et a l., 2020) achieve random chance performance of 25% accuracy, but the 175 billion parameter GPT-3 model reaches a much higher

## 43.9% accuracy (see Figure 1b). On the other hand, unlike human professionals GPT-3 does not

excel at any single subject. Instead, we ﬁnd that performance is lopsided, with GPT-3 having almost

## 70% accuracy for its best subject but near-random performance for several other subjects.

Our results indicate that while recent advances have been impressive, state-o f-the-art models still struggle at learning and applying knowledge from pretraining. The tasks with near-random accuracy include calculation-heavy subjects such as physics and mathematics and subjects related to human values such as law and morality. This second weakness is particularly concerning because it will be important for future models to have a strong understanding of what is legal and what is ethical. Worryingly, we also ﬁnd that GPT-3 does not have an accurate sense of what it does or does not know since its average conﬁdence can be u pt o 24% off from its actual accuracy. We comprehensively evaluate the breadth and depth of a model’s text understanding by covering numerous topics that humans are incentivized to learn. Since our test consists in 57 tasks, it can be used to analyze aggregate properties of models across tasks and to track important shortcomings. The test and code is available at github.com/hendrycks/test.

## 2 RELATED WORK

Pretraining. The dominant paradigm in NLP is to pretrain large models on massive text corpora including educational books and websites. In the process, these models are exposed to information about a wide range of topics. Petroni et a l. (2019) found that recent models learn enough information from pretraining that they can serve as knowledge bases. However, no prior work has comprehensively measured the knowledge models have across many real-world domains.

Until recently, researchers primarily used ﬁne-tuned models on downstream tasks (Devlin et a l., 2019). However, larger pretrained models like GPT-3 (Brown et a l., 2020) have made it possible to achieve competitive performance without ﬁne-tuning by using few-shot learning, which removes the need for a large ﬁne-tuning set. With the advent of strong zero-shot and few-shot learning, it is now possible to curate a diverse set of tasks for evaluation and remove the possibility of models on “spurious cues” (Geirhos et a l., 2020; Hendrycks et a l., 2019b) in a dataset to achieve high performance.

Benchmarks. Many recent benchmarks aim to assess a model’s general world knowledge and basic reasoning ability by testing its “commonsense.” A number of commonsense benchmarks have been2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021As Seller, an encyclopedia salesman, approached the grounds on which Hermit's house was situated, he saw a sign that said, "No salesmen. Trespassers will be prosecuted. Proceed at your own risk." Although Seller had not been invited to enter, he ignored the sign and drove up the driveway toward the house. As he rounded a curve, a powerful explosive charge buried in the driveway exploded, and Seller was injured. Can Seller recover damages from Hermit for his injuries? (A) Yes, unless Hermit, when he planted the charge, intended only to deter, not harm, intruders. (B) Yes, if Hermit was responsible for the explosive charge under the driveway. (C) No, because Seller ignored the sign, which warned him against proceeding further. (D) No, if Hermit reasonably feared that intruders would come and harm him or his family.Professional Law Figure 2: This task requires understanding detailed and dissonant scenarios, applying appropriate legal precedents, and choosing the correct explanation. The green checkmark is the ground truth.

proposed in the past year, but recent models are already nearing human-level performance on several of these, including HellaSwag (Zellers et a l., 2019), Physical IQA (Bisk et a l., 2019), and CosmosQA (Huang et a l., 2019). By design, these datasets assess abilities that almost every child has. In contrast, we include harder specialized subjects that people must study to learn.

Some researchers have suggested that the future of NLP evaluation should focus on Natural Language Generation (NLG) (Zellers et a l., 2020), an idea that reaches back to the Turing Test (Turing, 1950). However, NLG is notoriously difﬁcult to evaluate and lacks a standard metric (Sai et a l., 2020). Consequently, we instead create a simple-t o-evaluate test that measures classiﬁcation accuracy on multiple choice questions.

While several question answering benchmarks exist, they are comparatively limited in scope. Most either cover easy topics like grade school subjects for which models can already achieve strong performance (Clark et a l., 2018; Khot et a l., 2019; Mihaylov et a l., 2018; Clark et a l., 2019), or are focused on linguistic understanding in the form of reading comprehension (Lai et a l., 2017; Richardson et a l., 2013). In contrast, we include a wide range of difﬁcult subjects that go far beyond linguistic understanding.

## 3 A MULTITASK TEST

We create a massive multitask test consisting of multiple-choice questions from various branches of knowledge. The test spans subjects in the humanities, social sciences, hard sciences, and other areas that are important for some people to learn. There are 57 tasks in total, which is also the number of Atari games (Bellemare et a l., 2013), all of which are listed in Appendix B. The questions in the dataset were manually collected by graduate and undergraduate students from freely available sources online. These include practice questions for tests such as the Graduate Record Examination and the United States Medical Licensing Examination. It also includes questions designed for undergraduate courses and questions designed for readers of Oxford University Press books. Some tasks cover a subject, like psychology, but at a speciﬁc level of difﬁculty, such as “Elementary,” “High School,” “College,” or “Professional.” For example, the “Professional Psychology” task draws on questions from freely available practice questions for the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology, while the “High School Psychology” task has questions like those from Advanced Placement Psychology examinations.

We collected 15908 questions in total, which we split into a few-shot development set, a validation set, and a test set. The few-shot development set has 5 questions per subject, the validation set may be used for selecting hyperparameters and is made of 1540 questions, and the test set has 14079 questions. Each subject contains 100 test examples at the minimum, which is longer than most exams designed to assess people.

Human-level accuracy on this test varies. Unspecialized humans from Amazon Mechanical Turk obtain 34.5% accuracy on this test. Meanwhile, expert-level performance can be far higher. For example, real-world test-taker human accuracy at the 95th percentile is around 87% for US Medical Licensing Examinations, and these questions make up our “Professional Medicine” task. If we take the 95th percentile human test-taker accuracy for exams that build up our test, and if we make an educated guess when such information is unavailable, we then estimate that expert-level accuracy is approximately 89.8%.

Since our test aggregates different subjects and several levels of difﬁculty, we measure more than straightforward commonsense or narrow linguistic understanding. Instead, we measure arbitrary3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021One of the reasons that the government discourages and regulates monopolies is that (A) producer surplus is lost and consumer surplus is gained.

real-world text understanding. Since models are pretrained on the Internet, this enables us to test how well they can extract useful knowledge from massive corpora. Future models that use this test could be single models or a mixture of experts model. To succeed at our test, future models should be well-rounded, possess extensive world knowledge, and develop expert-level problem solving ability. These properties make the test likely to b ea n enduring and informative goalpost.

## 3.1 HUMANITIES

The humanities is a group of disciplines that make use of qualitative analysis and analytic methods rather than scientiﬁc empirical methods. Branches of the humanities include law, philosophy, history, and so on (Appendix B). Mastering these subjects requires a variety of skills. For example, legal understanding requires knowledge of how to apply rules and standards to complex scenarios, and also provide answers with stipulations and explanations. We illustrate this in Figure 2. Legal understanding is also necessary for understanding and following rules and regulations, a necessary capability to constrain open-world machine learning models. For philosophy, our questions cover concepts like logical fallacies, formal logic, and famous philosophical arguments. It also covers moral scenarios, including questions from the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et a l., 2020) that test a model’s understanding of normative statements through predicting widespread moral intuitions about diverse everyday scenarios. Finally, our history questions cover a wide range of time periods and geographical locations, including prehistory and other advanced subjects.

## 3.2 SOCIAL SCIENCE

Social science includes branches of knowledge that examine human behavior and society. Subject areas include economics, sociology, politics, geography, psychology, and so o n. See Figure 3 for an example question. Our economics questions include microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics, and cover different types of problems, including questions that require a mixture of world knowledge, qualitative reasoning, or quantitative reasoning. We also include important but more esoteric topics such as security studies in order to test the boundaries of what is experienced and learned during pretraining. Social science also includes psychology, a ﬁeld that may be especially important for attaining a nuanced understanding of humans.

## 3.3 SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM)

STEM subjects include physics, computer science, mathematics, and more. Two examples are shown in Figure 4. Conceptual physics tests understanding of simple physics principles and may be thought4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021A 33-year-old man undergoes a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer.

o fa sa harder version of the physical commonsense benchmark Physical IQA (Bisk et a l., 2019). We also test mathematical problem solving ability at various levels of difﬁculty, from the elementary to the college level. College mathematics questions, like those found on the GRE mathematics subject test, often require chains of reasoning and abstract knowledge. To encode mathematics expressions, we use LaTeX or symbols such as * and ˆ for multiplication and exponentiation respectively. STEM subjects require knowledge of empirical methods, ﬂuid intelligence, and procedural knowledge.

## 3.4 OTHER

There is a long tail of subjects that either do not neatly ﬁt into any of the three preceding categories or for which there are not thousands of freely available questions. We put these subjects into Other. This section includes the Professional Medicine task, which has difﬁcult questions that require humans many years of study to master. An example is depicted in Figure 5. This section also contains business topics like ﬁnance, accounting, and marketing, as well as knowledge of global facts. The latter includes statistics about poverty in different countries over time, which may be necessary for having an accurate model of the world internationally.

## 4 EXPERIMENTS

## 4.1 SETUP

Assessment and Models. To measure performance on our multitask test, we compute the classiﬁcation accuracy across all examples and tasks. We evaluate GPT-3 (Brown et a l., 2020) and UniﬁedQA (Khashabi et a l., 2020). For GPT-3 we use the OpenAI API, which provides access to four model variants, “Ada,” “Babbage,” “Curie,” and “Davinci,” which we refer to as “Small” (2.7 billion parameters), “Medium” (6.7 billion), “Large” (13 billion) and “X-Large” (175 billion). UniﬁedQA uses the T5 (Raffel et a l., 2019) text-t o-text backbone and is ﬁne-tuned on previously proposed question answering datasets (Lai et a l., 2017), where the prediction is the class with the highest token overlap with UniﬁedQA’s text output. Since UniﬁedQA is ﬁne-tuned on other datasets, we evaluate it without any further tuning to assess its transfer accuracy. We also ﬁne-tune RoBERTa-base, ALBERT-xxlarge, and GPT-2 on UniﬁedQA training data and our dev+val set. We primarily focus on UniﬁedQA and GPT-3 in the rest of this document, but additional discussion of RoBERTa, ALBERT, and GPT-2 is in Appendix A.

Few-Shot Prompt. We feed GPT-3 prompts like that shown in Figure 1a. We begin each prompt with “The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about [subject].” For zero-shot evaluation, we append the question to the prompt. For few-shot evaluation, we add up to 5 demonstration examples with answers to the prompt before appending the question. All prompts end with “Answer: ”. The model then produces probabilities for the tokens “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D,” and we treat the highest probability option as the prediction. For consistent evaluation, we create a dev set with 5 ﬁxed few-shot examples for each subject.

## 4.2 RESULTS

Model Size and Accuracy. We compare the few-shot accuracy of each GPT-3 size in Table 1. We ﬁnd that the three smaller GPT-3 models have near random accuracy (around 25%). In contrast, we ﬁnd that the X-Large 175 billion parameter GPT-3 model performs substantially better than random, with an accuracy of 43.9%. We also ﬁnd qualitatively similar results in the zero-shot setting. While the smaller models have around 25% zero-shot accuracy, Figure 10 in Appendix A shows that the largest GPT-3 model has a much higher zero-shot accuracy of about 37.7%. Brown et a l. (2020) also observe that larger GPT-3 models perform better, though progress tends to be steadier. In Figure 1b we show that non-random accuracy on the multitask test emerged with recent large few-shot models compared to datasets that assess commonsense and linguistic understanding.

To test the usefulness of ﬁne-tuning instead of few-shot learning, we also evaluate UniﬁedQA models. UniﬁedQA has the advantage of being ﬁne-tuned on other question answering datasets, unlike GPT-3. We assess UniﬁedQA by evaluating its transfer performance without any additional ﬁne-tuning. The largest UniﬁedQA model we test has 11 billion parameters, which is slightly smaller than GPT-3 Large. Nevertheless, we show in Table 1 that it attains 48.9% accuracy. This performs better than the few-shot GPT-3 X-Large model, despite UniﬁedQA have an order of magnitude fewer parameters. We also ﬁnd that even the smallest UniﬁedQA variant, with just 60 million parameters, has approximately 29.3% accuracy. These results suggest that while model size is a key component for achieving strong performance, ﬁne-tuning also helps.

Comparing Disciplines. Using our test, we discover that GPT-3 and UniﬁedQA have lopsided performance and several substantial knowledge gaps. Figure 6 shows the accuracy of GPT-3 (fewshot) and UniﬁedQA for all 57 tasks. It shows the both models are below expert-level performance for all tasks, with GPT-3’s accuracy ranging from 69% for US Foreign Policy to 26% for College Chemistry. UniﬁedQA does best on marketing, with an accuracy of 82.5%.

Overall, models do poorly on highly procedural problems. Figure 6 shows that calculation-heavy STEM subjects tend to have low accuracy compared to verbal subjects. For GPT-3, 9 out of the 106Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021Declarative v s.

lowest-accuracy tasks are STEM subjects that emphasize mathematics or calculations. We speculate that is in part because GPT-3 acquires declarative knowledge more readily than procedural knowledge. For example, many questions in Elementary Mathematics require applying the order of operations for arithmetic, which is described by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction). In Figure 7, we conﬁrm that GPT-3 is aware of the acronym PEMDAS. However, it does not consistently apply PEMDAS to actual problems. On the other hand, procedural understanding is not its only weak point. We ﬁnd that some verbal tasks such as Moral Scenarios from Hendrycks et a l. (2020) and Professional Law also have especially low accuracy.

Our test also shows that GPT-3 acquires knowledge quite unlike humans. For example, GPT-3 learns about topics in a pedagogically unusual order. GPT-3 does better on College Medicine (47.4%) and College Mathematics (35.0%) than calculation-heavy Elementary Mathematics (29.9%). GPT-3 demonstrates unusual breadth, but it does not master a single subject. Meanhwhile we suspect humans have mastery in several subjects but not as much breadth. In this way, our test shows that GPT-3 has many knowledge blindspots and has capabilities that are lopsided.

Calibration. We should not trust a model’s prediction unless the model is calibrated, meaning that its conﬁdence is a good estimate of the actual probability the prediction is correct. However, large neural networks are often miscalibrated (Guo et a l., 2017), especially under distribution shift (Ovadia et a l., 2019). We evaluate the calibration of GPT-3 by testing how well its average conﬁdence estimates its actual accuracy for each subject. We show the results in Figure 8, which demonstrates that GPT-3 is uncalibrated. In fact, its conﬁdence is only weakly related to its actual accuracy in the zero-shot setting, with the difference between its accuracy and conﬁdence reaching up to 24% for some subjects. Another calibration measure is the Root Mean Squared (RMS) calibration error (Hendrycks et a l., 2019a; Kumar et a l., 2019). Many tasks have miscalibrated predictions, such as Elementary Mathematics which has a zero-shot RMS calibration error of 19.4%. Models are only somewhat more calibrated in the few-shot setting, as shown in Appendix A. These results suggest that model calibration has wide room for improvement.

## 5 DISCUSSION

Multimodal Understanding. While text is capable of conveying an enormous number of concepts about the world, many important concepts are conveyed mainly through other modalities, such as images, audio, and physical interaction (Bisk et a l., 2020). Existing large-scale NLP models, such as GPT-3, do not incorporate multimodal information, so we design our benchmark to capture a diverse array of tasks in a text-only format. However, as models gain the ability to process multimodal inputs, benchmarks should be designed to reﬂect this change. One such benchmark could be a “Turk Test,” consisting of Amazon Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks. These are well-deﬁned tasks that require models to interact with ﬂexible formats and demonstrate multimodal understanding.

The Internet as a Training Set. A major distinction between our benchmark and previous multitask NLP benchmarks is that we do not require large training sets. Instead, we assume that models have acquired the requisite knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the Internet. This7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021process is typically called pretraining, but it can be thought of as training in its own right, where the downstream evaluation is demonstrating whatever knowledge we would expect a human to pick up from reading the same text.

This motivates us to propose a methodological change so that models are trained more like how humans learn. While most previous machine learning benchmarks have models learn from a large question bank, humans primarily learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk about the topic. For specialized subjects such as Professional Law, massive legal corpora are available, such as the 164-volume legal encyclopedia Corpus Juris Secundum, but there are fewer than 5,000 multistate bar exam questions available. Learning the entire law exclusively through a small number of practice tests is implausible, so future models must learn more during pretraining.

For this reason we assess pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting and we provide a dev, val, and test set for each task. The dev set is used for few-shot prompts, the val set could be used for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set is used to compute the ﬁnal accuracy. Importantly, the format of our evaluation is not identical to the format in which information is acquired during pretraining. This has the beneﬁt of obviating concerns about spurious training set annotation artifacts (Geirhos et a l., 2020; Hendrycks et a l., 2019b) and is in stark contrast to the previous paradigm of identically distributed training and test sets. This change also enables collecting a much more extensive and diverse set of tasks for evaluation. We anticipate our methodology becoming more widespread as models improve at extracting information from diverse online sources.

Model Limitations. We ﬁnd that current large-scale Transformers have wide room for improvement. They are notably poor at modeling human (dis)approval, as evident by the low performance on the Professional Law and Moral Scenarios tasks. For future systems to be aligned with human values, high performance on these tasks is crucial (Hendrycks et a l., 2020), so future research should especially aim to increase accuracy on these tasks. Models also have difﬁculty performing calculations, so much so that they exhibit poor performance on Elementary Mathematics and many other STEM subjects with “plug and chug” problems. Additionally, they do not match expert-level performance (90%) on any subject, so for all subjects it is subhuman. On average, models are only now starting to move beyond random-chance accuracy levels.

Addressing these shortcomings may be challenging. To illustrate this, we attempted to create a better Professional Law model by pretraining on specialized data but achieved only limited success. We collected approximately 2,000 additional Professional Law training examples. After ﬁne-tuning a RoBERTa-base model (Liu et a l., 2019) using this custom training set, our model attained 32.8% test accuracy. To test the impact of additional specialized training data, we also had RoBERTa continue pretraining on approximately 1.6 million legal case summaries using Harvard’s Law Library case law corpus case.law, but after ﬁne-tuning it only attained 36.1% accuracy. This suggests that while additional pretraining on relevant high quality text can help, it may not be enough to substantially increase the performance of current models.

It is unclear whether simply scaling up existing language models will solve the test. Current understanding indicates that a 10× increase in model size must be accompanied by an approximate 5× increase in data (Kaplan et a l., 2020). Aside from the tremendous expense in creating multi-trillion parameter language models, data may also become a bottleneck, as there is far less written about esoteric branches of knowledge than about everyday situations.

## 6 CONCLUSION

We introduced a new test that measures how well text models can learn and apply knowledge encountered during pretraining. By covering 57 subjects at varying levels of difﬁculty, the test assesses language understanding in greater breadth and depth than previous benchmarks. We found that it has recently become possible for models to make meaningful progress on the test, but that state-o f-the-art models have lopsided performance and rarely excel at any individual task. We also showed that current models are uncalibrated and have difﬁculty with tasks that require calculations. Worryingly, models also perform especially poorly on socially relevant subjects including morality and law. Our expansive test can help researchers pinpoint important shortcomings of models, making it easier to gain a clearer picture of state-o f-the-art capabilities.

Random ChanceFigure 9: On the left are GPT-3 few shot accuracies for all of the 57 tasks. On the right are UniﬁedQA transfer accuracies for all of the 57 tasks. For both models, capabilities are lopsided.

A.1 ANALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELSWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10 billion parameters in the main body of the paper. For this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu11Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021et a l., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et a l., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million parameters) (Radford et a l., 2019). Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the UniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.

We observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains an overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9% accuracy for the humanities, 28.8% for social sciences,

## 27.0% for STEM, and 27.7% for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%

accuracy for the humanities, 25.7% for the social sciences, 27.7% for STEM, and 27.9% for other. GPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8% accuracy for the humanities, 33.3% for the social sciences, 30.2% for STEM, and 33.1% for other.

Compare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60 million parameters and approximately

## 29.3% accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer

parameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise, UniﬁedQA with 3 billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5 billion parameters attains 32.4% accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset size (and therefore UniﬁedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.

A.2 ERROR ANALYSISWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high conﬁdence mistakes. We ﬁnd that while many of these mistakes were clearly wrong, many were mistakes that a human might make. For example, one question it got wrong was “How many chromosomes do all human somatic cells contain?” The correct answer is 46, while few-shot GPT-3 predicted 23 with conﬁdence 97.5%. This answer would have been correct if the question asked about the number of pairs of chromosomes. Similarly, many of its other high conﬁdence mistakes were also correct answers to slightly different questions.

A.3 FORMAT SENSITIVITYWhile different question formatting choices often lead to similar GPT-3 accuracies, we ﬁnd that UniﬁedQA is more sensitive. UniﬁedQA’s input format is of the formQUESTION1 \\n (A) CHOICE1 (B) CHOICE2 (C) CHOICE3 (D) CHOICE4</s>where questions and choices are normalized and made lowercase. If we remove the </s> from the input, accuracy declines by several percentage points.

GPT-3 Few-Shot Calibration Figure 11: While models are more calibrated in a few-shot setting than a zero-shot setting, they are still miscalibrated, with gap between accuracy and conﬁdence reaching up to 14%. Here the correlation between conﬁdence and accuracy is r = 0.81, compared to r = 0.63 in the zero-shot setting.

B TEST DETAILSB.1 TASK DESCRIPTIONS AND EXAMPLESWe provide analysis of question length and difﬁculty in Figure 12. We list all tasks and the topics they test in Table 2. We also provide an example for each task starting with Figure 14.

GPT-3 Average Question Length and Accuracy by SubjectFigure 12: Figures on the relation between question difﬁculty and question length. For questions longer than a tweet (280 characters), the correlation between question length and true label conﬁdence is slightly positive. This shows that longer questions are not necessarily harder.

B.2 EXACT QUESTION AND ANSWER CONTAMINATIONSince language models train on vast text corpora, there is some chance that they have seen the exact question and answer during pretraining. If they memorized the exact question and answer, then they would attain higher accuracy than their true ability. Likewise, a question’s entropy would be especially low if it were memorized. Memorized questions and answers should have low entropy and13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021high accuracy. However, in Figure 13, we see that accuracy and question entropy are not positively correlated, suggesting that the test’s low-entropy questions do not correspond to memorized (and thereby correctly predicted) answers. This suggests that our exact questions were not memorized. However, during pretraining models encountered text related to our questions through processing Wikipedia. We also note that most of our questions came from PDFs or websites where questions and answers are on separate pages.

See Brown et a l. (2020) for a previous discussion of contamination showing that the phenomena hardly affects performance. To reduce the probability that future models encounter exact questions during test-time, we will provide a list of question sources.

Each point corresponds to a task. Higher log probability indicates higher compression, and especially high log probability would suggest memorization. In the zero-shot question prompt, the correlation between average log probability and accuracy is r = −0.43, and for the few-shot setting the correlation is r = −0.56.

16Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisﬁed by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?

This question refers to the following information. “Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reﬂecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he ﬁnds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to d ob y the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it t ou s, with the least expense and greatest beneﬁt, is preferable to all others.” Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776 Which of the following “miseries” alluded to above were most condemned by Anti-Federalists of the post-Revolutionary era? (A) Organized response to Bacon’s Rebellion. (B) Federal response to Shays’s Rebellion. (C) Federal response to the Whiskey Rebellion. (D) Federal response to Pontiac’s Rebellion.

This question refers to the following information. “The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unﬁt to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, left to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.” Otto von Bismarck, 1884 Otto von Bismarck likely made this speech in reaction to which of the following issues? (A) Social acceptance of child labor. (B) Declining life expectancy in Germany. (C) Criticisms of German trade tariffs. (D) Negative effects attributed to industrial capitalism.

The night before his bar examination, the examinee’s next-door neighbor was having a party. The music from the neighbor’s home was so loud that the examinee couldn’t fall asleep. The examinee called the neighbor and asked her to please keep the noise down. The neighbor then abruptly hung u p. Angered, the examinee went into his closet and got a gun. He went outside and ﬁred a bullet through the neighbor’s living room window. Not intending to shoot anyone, the examinee ﬁred his gun at such an angle that the bullet would hit the ceiling. He merely wanted to cause some damage to the neighbor’s home to relieve his angry rage. The bullet, however, ricocheted off the ceiling and struck a partygoer in the back, killing him. The jurisdiction makes it a misdemeanor to discharge a ﬁrearm in public. The examinee will most likely be found guilty for which of the following crimes in connection to the death of the partygoer? (A) Murder. (B) Involuntary manslaughter. (C) Voluntary manslaughter. (D) Discharge of a ﬁrearm in public.

25Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. (A) The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. (B) The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. (C) Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining inﬂuence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. (D) While the CWC has been ratiﬁed by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the "poor mans" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations.
