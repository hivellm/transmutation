We introduce, for each state of a bosonic quantum ﬁeld, its quadrature coherence scale (QCS), a measure of the range of its quadrature coherences. Under coupling to a thermal bath, the purity and QCS are shown to decrease on a time scale inversely proportional to the QCS squared. The states most fragile to decoherence are therefore those with quadrature coherences far from the diagonal. We further show a large QCS is diﬃcult to measure since it induces small scale variations in the state’s Wigner function. These two observations imply a large QCS constitutes a mark of “macroscopic coherence”. Finally, we link the QCS to optical classicality: optical classical states have a small QCS and a large QCS implies strong optical nonclassicality.

I. INTRODUCTIONBoth in order to obtain an ever better understanding of quantum physics and to solve problems in quantum information theory, there is continued interest in the exploration of the classical-quantum boundary and the identiﬁcation of those quantum states exhibiting speciﬁcally quantum features, such as coherence and interference that cannot be explained with classical mechanics and/o r classical probability theory. It has been shown on example states in model systems [1–6] that fast decoherence results from the interaction of the system with its environment when the system is suitably “macroscopic”. It is therefore much harder to generate, maintain and detect coherence on a macroscopic scale than on a microscopic one. These results contribute to clarifying why the observation of coherent superpositions is not part of our every day experience and why building large scale quantum computers is a major challenge. To render the previous observations quantitative and general, several diﬀerent characterizations have been proposed of the “coherence” [7, 8], “large-scale quantum coherence” [9–11], “macroscopic coherence” [10, 12], “quantum macroscopicity” [10, 13, 14], “macroscopic quantumness” [10, 15–18] and “macroscopic distinctness” [13, 18, 19] of quantum states. Resource theories for those closely related properties of states have also been developed [7, 8, 10, 12, 20]. An important and to the best of our knowledge unaddressed question concerning these quantities is to evaluate the rate at which they decrease when the system is coupled to its environment: i.e. to evaluate their sensitivity to environmental decoherence. We will address the latter question for the states of a bosonic quantum ﬁeld for which we introduce the quadrature coherence scale (QCS), deﬁned as a measure of the scale on which the coherences of its quadratures are appreciable (see (4)). As we will show, a small QCS means the coherences for all quadratures are small far from the diagonal. We call such states quadrature quasi-incoherent. A large QCS means on the contrary that, given any pair of conjugate quadratures, at least one has appreciable coherences far from the diagonal. In addition, it implies the state is strongly optically nonclassical. We show the QCS of a state, if initially large, decreases fast when the system is coupled to an environment. The corresponding characteristic time scale is inversely proportional to the (square of the) QCS itself. Purity loss takes place on a similar time scale. Therefore, the states very sensitive to environmental decoherence are precisely those with a large QCS. This result generalizes known results on the decoherence of optical cat states [2–6] to all mixed or pure states of the ﬁeld mode. We further establish that states with a large QCS are hard to observe since their Wigner functions have small scale structures. The QCS thus furnishes a physical parameter that measures the “coherence size” of the state and that is directly related to the decoherence rate.

II. COHERENCE, INTERFERENCE AND COHERENCE SCALETo reveal the quantum nature of a state ρ, one may proceed as follows. Consider two noncommuting observables A and B that we suppose for simplicity to have associated orthonormal eigenbases |a i⟩, |b m⟩. Let pA( a i) = ⟨a i|ρ|a i⟩ and pB( b m) = ⟨b m|ρ|b m⟩. Then pB( b m) = p diag B (b m) + ∑i̸=j ⟨b m|a i⟩⟨a j|b m⟩⟨a i|ρ|a j⟩. (1)Here p diag B (b m) = ∑ i |⟨b m|a i⟩|


## 2pA( a i) is of “classical” nature in the sense that it is the term expected from a n

application of classical probability theory. The second term – the interference term – is of typical quantum nature.arXiv:1909.05025v2  [quant-p h]  11 Mar 2020 2It is absent when ρ has no oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements ⟨a i|ρ|a j⟩, the s o-called “coherences.” For an overview of measures and monotones of coherence for observables with discrete spectrum, we refer to [8], and references therein. If ρ is diagonal in the A basis (ρ is then said to be A-incoherent) or if its coherences in this basis are small, the quantum nature of ρ is not revealed in this manner and one can then say that, in this restricted sense, the state “behaves classically”. The state’s quantum nature may however still be revealed by another choice of observables. In this view, there is no such thing as “the” nonclassical nature of a state, but rather the degree to which various measurements can reveal its quantum nature, notably through interference terms. The relation of this analysis to the independent notion of optical (non)classicality of the states of a bosonic quantum ﬁeld mode will be discussed below. As will become clear below, for our purposes, it is not so much the size of the coherences as their location which is important. To evaluate how far from the diagonal the coherences occur, we write P = Tr ρ


## 2 for the purity, and

consider the probability density on the (a, a ′)-plane:

µ(a, a ′) = ∑i,j |⟨a i|ρ|a j⟩| 2P δ(a − a i)δ(a ′ − a j).

It describes the spatial repartition of the matrix elements of ρ and in particular of its coherences. We deﬁne the A-coherence scale CA(ρ) of ρ viaC2 A(ρ) =∑i,j (a i − a j)2 |⟨a i|ρ|a j⟩| 2P = ∫ (a − a ′)2µ(a, a ′)dada ′,which is the variance of the eigenvalue spacings of A so that, when CA(ρ) is large, there are coherences far from the diagonal: CA(ρ) determines the scale on which the coherences of ρ live. It is easy to check that for pure states C2 A(ρ) = 2(∆A)2. A simple calculation shows furthermore C2 A(ρ) = P −1 Tr[ρ, A][A, ρ], an expression valid also when A has continuous spectrum. We stress that CA is not a measure of the A-coherence of the state; it does not establish “how much” coherence there i s, but “where” it i s. For example, two states |a i⟩ + |a j⟩ and |a i⟩ + |a k⟩ have oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements of the same size, and in this sense the same “amount” of coherence, but their A-coherence scale is proportional to |a i − a j|, respectively |a i − a k|, and can therefore strongly diﬀer [10].

III. QUADRATURE COHERENCE SCALE-QUADRATURE QUASI-COHERENCEWe consider a state ρ of a single-mode ﬁeld, characterized by an annihilation-creation operator pair a, a †. We are interested in the coherence scale of its quadratures and deﬁne, in analogy with what precedes, its quadrature coherence scale (QCS) C(ρ) through C2(ρ) = 1

where X = a †+a√2 , P = i( a †−a) √2 . With Xθ = cos θX + sin θP , Pθ = − sin θX + cos θP , one has alsoC2(ρ) = 1

s o that C2(ρ) is the average coherence scale (squared) of any pair of conjugate quadratures. Equation (2) impliesC2(ρ) = 1 2P (∫ (x − x′)2|ρ(x, x ′)|


## 2dxdx′ + ∫ (p − p

′)2|ρ(p, p ′)| 2dpdp ′) . (4)Here ρ(x, x ′) (respectively ρ(p, p ′)) is the operator kernel of ρ in the X-representation (respectively P -representation). It follows from (3)-(4) that a large C(ρ) implies that for every pair (Xθ, Pθ) of conjugate quadratures, at least one has a large coherence scale. Conversely, a small C(ρ) implies that the oﬀ-diagonal coherences of all quadratures must be small away from the diagonal. We stress that no state ρ can be Xθ - or Pθ -incoherent in the sense that ρ cannot be diagonal in the corresponding representation (see Appendix A). Mixed states can nevertheless have an arbitrarily small QCS, as we will see below. For pure states, (2) implies C2(ρ) = (∆X)2 +(∆P )2, the s o-called total noise of ρ [21]. It follows that, on pure states, the QCS is larger than 1; it reaches its minimal value of 1 only on the coherent states |α⟩ = D(α)|0⟩, where |0⟩ is the vacuum state and D(α) = exp(αa

† − α∗a). For optical cat states |ψα⟩ ∼ (|α⟩ + | − α⟩),

a simple computation (see Appendix D) yields Cα ≃ |α| (|α| ≫ 1): “large” cats have a large QCS in agreement with the observation that ρα(x, x ′) = ⟨x|ψα⟩⟨ψα|x′⟩ has large oﬀ-diagonal elements in the neighbourhood of x = −x′ = ±α3-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 -6-4-20246 x x' -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 -6-4-20246 x x' -0.10-0.0500.050.100.150.20 FIG. 1.

i f α is real. We will refer to states for which C(ρ) ≤ 1 as quadrature quasi-incoherent states. In fact, we will see below that C2 has the particular feature of providing a measure of optical non-classicality. It follows from [22, 23] that the right hand side of (2) can be expressed in terms of the Wigner function W (α) or the characteristic function χ(ξ) [24, 25] as follows: C2(ρ) = ∥|ξ|χ∥2 2 ∥χ∥2

The deﬁnition (2) and expression (5) carry over to multimode systems by summing over a complete set of conjugate quadratures.

For a centered Gaussian state ρG with covariance matrix V = ( 2TrρX 2 Trρ(XP +P X) Trρ(XP +P X) 2TrρP 2 ), one ﬁnds (see Ap-pendix C): C2 G = C2(ρG) = ((∆X)

It follows that Gaussian mixed states can have an arbitrarily small QCS. This can happen even if the total noise is very large. One notes for example in Fig. 1 that the coherences of the thermal state with mean photon number n = 5 are concentrated along the diagonal. This reﬂects the fact that for thermal states C(ρth) = (1 + 2n)−1/2, which follows from (6). We note that for Gaussian states 4C2 G coincides with the sum of the quantum Fisher information of two conjugate quadratures (see Appendix C), which is known to provide a useful lower bound for proposed measures and monotones of quantum macroscopicity [10] and nonclassicality [26]. On non-Gaussian states, however, the two quantities can diﬀer greatly (for an example see [23]). As an example of non-Gaussian states we consider the family of even states, with M a positive integer:

ρM = 1 M M∑k=1 |2k⟩⟨2k|.

One has C(ρM ) = √2M + 3 [23] and Fig. 1 shows that, indeed, the coherences have a large oﬀ-diagonal branch that can be checked to grow as √2M , as expected. Since PM = M −1, this shows that very strongly mixed states can have a very large QCS. Other examples of this phenomenon are the strongly squeezed thermal states for which a very small purity can be compensated by a very large total noise (see (6) and Appendix C). 4ρM |ψ α〉ρs t h|n〉

right order of magnitude (see Appendix B) and reduces to the known result for pure states [2, 3, 5]. Simultaneously with the purity loss, there is QCS loss. Indeed, the time evolution of the QCS, and in particular its sharp initial drop (Fig. 2), can be explained by analyzing the diﬀerential equation for C( t) (see Appendix B):

These results show in all generality that the purity loss and the destruction of the large scale quadrature coherences of any initial state are determined by the temperature of the environment and by two parameters characteristic of the initial state: the QCS C0 and κ0. They generalize the known results for optical cat states [2–5] to all pure and mixed states. V. EFFECTS OF A LARGE QCSThe expressions in (5) show that a large value of the QCS corresponds to a large spread of the characteristic function and to the existence of small scale structures in the Wigner function [22, 23]. Indeed, ∥|ξ|χ∥2 2/∥χ∥2


## 2 is the mean of |ξ|

2with respect to the probability density |χ(ξ)|2/∥χ∥2


## 2. Hence, a large value of the QCS corresponds to a characteristic

function with a wide spread in at least some directions in the ξ-plane, a manifestation of the well known link between the characteristic function and the coherences [29]:

χ(− µ sin θ √2 , µ cos θ √2 ) = Tr exp( iµXθ) = ∫ ρ(pθ, pθ + µ)dpθ.

On the other hand, a large QCS implies the gradient of W is large, which means the graph of W must have steep slopes, at least in some places of the phase plane, a signature either of oscillations or of sharp peaks [15, 23]. For Gaussian states, this phenomenon manifests itself in that the variance of the probability distribution of one of the quadratures is of order C−2 (more details in Appendix C). A faithful reconstruction of the Wigner function through quantum tomography therefore requires great accuracy when C ≫ 1. States with a large QCS are therefore hard to observe. That it is generally diﬃcult to measure optical cat states and analogous states in other systems, when their components have a “macroscopic” separation, was proven in [19]. We have here established the same result for all mixed or pure states of a bosonic quantum ﬁeld with a large QCS. To see how a large coherence scale can lead to strong interference eﬀects, we consider the states ρM (Fig. 1) and choose A = X and B = N = a †a and writepN (n) = p diag,ℓ N (n) + ∫|x′−x|≥ℓ⟨x′|n⟩⟨n|x⟩ρ(x, x ′)dxdx′,i n analogy with (1). Here p diag,ℓ N (n) = ∫|x′−x|≤ℓ⟨x′|n⟩⟨n|x⟩ρ(x, x ′)dxdx′. (10)Contrary to when A has a discrete spectrum, as in (1), one cannot sharply isolate the diagonal part of the state. Nevertheless, as the left panel of Fig. 3 illustrates, it is the contribution of the coherences far from the diagonal that generate the sharp oscillations or fringes in pN (n). In fact, it is clear (see Fig. 3) that the term p diag,ℓ N (n) shows a mildly oscillating behaviour for ℓ = 1, which i s, as ℓ grows, enhanced by the interference terms to yield pN (2k) = 1/M (constructive interference), pN (2k+1) = 0 (destructive interference). That the dynamical loss of large scale coherences leads to a sharp decrease of this interference eﬀect is illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 3: at the QCS half life τC = 0.033 of the state, the interferences are already considerably suppressed.

VI. QUADRATURE COHERENCE SCALE AND OPTICAL (NON)CLASSICALITYLet Ccl be the set of optical classical states, i.e. all mixtures of coherent states [30]. A number of witnesses, measures and monotones of optical nonclassicality have been designed [23, 26, 30–53] to identify non optical classical states and to quantify their degree of non optical classicality. Those quantities are often hard to compute, to measure, or to give a clear physical meaning. It is in particular not evident how they relate to standard manifestations of speciﬁcally quantum behaviour such as coherence and interference, nor how they evolve when coupled to a thermal bath. We show here a quantitative link between optical (non)classicality, the presence of coherences, and (fast) decoherence.

Right panel: values of pN (n) at t = 0.01 (dashed green line) and t = 0.033 = τC (dotted blue line).

Our analysis is based on the optical nonclassicality distance d(ρ, Ccl) deﬁned in [23] using a quantity denoted So(ρ) which measures the sensitivity of the state to operator ordering. One of its expression is So(ρ) = 1


## 4 ∥∇W ∥2

2 ∥W ∥2


## 2 . In view

o f (5), this means C2(ρ) = So(ρ). In other words, the QCS provides a new physical interpretation of the ordering sensitivity in terms of quadrature coherences, and the associated physical phenomena described above. In view of the bound C(ρ) − 1 ≤ d(ρ, Ccl) ≤ C(ρ) (11)proven in [23], C(ρ) is a good estimate of the distance between ρ and the optical classical states when C(ρ) ≫ 1. Hence the states far from the optical classical states are those with quadrature coherences far from the diagonal. In view of what precedes, they are the most fragile to decoherence. Conversely, when ρ ∈ Ccl, d(ρ, Ccl) = 0 and it follows from (11) that C(ρ) ≤ 1: optical classical states are quadrature quasi-incoherent. Finally, the smaller the QCS of ρ, the closer it i st o the optical classical states. This link between coherence and optical nonclassicality is speciﬁc to the quadrature coherences. It is for example not present in the a

†a-coherence of the state.

VII. CONCLUSIONWe introduced, for any bosonic state , its quadrature coherence scale (QCS), a measure of how far from the diagonal its quadrature coherences lie. We established that the states with a large QCS are strongly optically nonclassical, hard to observe, and very sensitive to environmental decoherence. These results generalize the known fast decoherence of “large” optical cat states [2–6] to all pure or mixed states with a large QCS. One may thus legitimately argue that the QCS provides a measure of “quantum macroscopicity”. Indeed, when the QCS is large, the state is “strongly nonclassical” in the sense that it is far from the optical classical states and its far oﬀ-diagonal coherences can be understood as a form of “macroscopicity”. Also, when the QCS is small, the states are close to the optical classical states and in this sense have a low degree of “quanticity”. Our results thus strongly support a suggestion in [26], were it is surmised that there may be a link between optical nonclassicality and macroscopic quantum eﬀects.

s o CX (ρ) = 0 implies ρ(x, x ′) = σ(x)δ(x − x′). Hence, in the X-representation, ρ is a multiplication operator: ⟨x|ρ|ψ⟩ = σ(x)⟨x|ψ⟩. Such an operator cannot have an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions with corresponding eigenvalues 0 ≤ pi ≤ 1, ∑∞ i=1 pi = 1. So CX (ρ) > 0 ∀ρ. It is clear, on the other hand, that CX (ρ) can be arbitrarily small. Note that, for |x − x′| ≫ CX (ρ), ρ(x, x ′) must be small. In other words, states with a small CX (ρ) have appreciable X-coherences along the diagonal only. The same is true for any of the quadratures Xθ or Pθ.

As shown in the table of Fig.4, this approximation is not very accurate but gives the right order of magnitude. For Gaussian states, a better approximation can be obtained (see Eq. (C14)). The analytical expression of C( t) = C(ρ(t)) obtained in (B2)-(B4) is not very informative. It does in particular not provide a simple expression for the time scale for coherence loss in term of the parameters of the model and of the initial condition. To remedy this situation, we establish the diﬀerential equation for C( t). First, we deﬁne moments of ξt as ⟨⟨ξ2k⟩⟩t = ∫ |ξ|

QCS of a Gaussian state. The QCS of any Gaussian state can be computed with Eqs. (B2)-(B4):

## 2 Tr V −1. (C3)

Since C(ρ) is invariant under phase-space translations, this expression is valid for all Gaussian states not necessarily centered at the origin. CG is also invariant under rotation. One can diagonalize V with a rotation of angle θ∗ so that σxθ∗ pθ∗ = 0. There exist two such angles, but we choseit such that σ2 xθ∗ ≤ σ2 pθ∗ . We have from Eq. (C3) that C2 G = 1 4 ( 1 σ2 xθ∗ + 1 σ2 pθ∗ ) . Hence,1 2σ2 pθ∗ = 1

χ(− 1 √2 µ sin θ, 1 √2 µ cos θ) = Tr exp( iµXθ) = ∫ ρ(pθ, pθ + µ)dpθ. (C6)Since the left-hand side of (C6) behaves as exp(− 1


## 2 µ

2σ2 xθ∗ ), its spread is wide, of order σ−1 xθ∗ . This implies the ρ(pθ∗ , pθ∗ + µ) coherences in the right-hand side have a support in µ of the same order. The coherences ρ(xθ∗ , xθ∗ + µ), on the other hand, live on the small scale σ−1 pθ∗ . We can also easily compute from (B7) κG = κ(ρG) = 2 − det V (σ2 x + σ2 p)2 . (C7)Note that 1 ≤ κG ≤ 2 and in particular, κG = 1 for all thermal state while it tends to 2 when the squeezing becomes large. Table I lists the values of the QCS, the purity and κG for some speciﬁc examples of Gaussian states.

Evolution of the QCS. Since a Gaussian state remains Gaussian during the time evolution, both CG( t) and κG( t) can be evaluated using the covariance matrix at time t given byV (t) = e −t/tR ( cos ωt sin ωt − sin ωt cos ωt) V (cos ωt − sin ωt sin ωt cos ωt ) + (2¯n∞ + 1) (1 − e−t/tR ) 1 (C8)and Eqs. (C3)-(C7). The exact expression of the QCS obtained in this manner is however not easy to interpret. It turns out that for Gaussian states κG( t) evolves slowly, a fact that can be anticipated by the observation that 1 ≤ κG( t) ≤ 2 for all t and that can also be conﬁrmed numerically. Now, assuming κG( t) ≃ κG(0) the solution of Eq. (B8) is easily computed: C2 G( t) = C2 0 e−t/tR + C2


## 0 κ0(2¯n∞ + 1)(1 − e−t/tR ) . (C9)

where C2 G(0) ≡ C0 and κG(0) ≡ κ0. From i t, we deduce the QCS half life, that is the the time τC,G when CG(τC,G) = C0/2 (provided C2

) tR. (C11)Both times are inversely proportional to the square of the QCS, κ0 and to the temperature of the bath (proportional to ¯n∞). Figure 5 shows the evolution of CG( t) for diﬀerent Gaussian states (w e only consider squeezed thermal states which have diagonal covariance matrix as CG is invariant under rotations). Plain lines show the exact evolution while the approximation obtained with Eq. (C9) is shown by the dashed lines. As we can see Eq. (C9) provides a very good estimation of CG( t), especially for short times.

Evolution of the purity. Knowing the evolution of the QCS for a Gaussian state, it is possible to compute the evolution of its purity PG( t) by solving Eq. (B5) where one replaces C by CG given in Eq. (C9). The solution is given by PG( t) = P(0)e t/tR (1 + C2

Quantum Fisher information.
