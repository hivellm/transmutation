## 📝 Output Quality Comparison

### Structure Preservation
✅ **Excellent Match:**
- Document title with `##` heading
- Author information (name + affiliation + email on single lines)
- Abstract section with `##` heading
- Numbered sections (1, 2, 3, etc.) with `##` headings
- Paragraph text properly joined
- Footnotes preserved (∗, †, ‡)
- References maintained

### Text Extraction
✅ **Features Working:**
- Proper line joining (removes artificial line breaks)
- Paragraph boundary detection
- Heading detection (title, Abstract, numbered sections)
- Symbol preservation (mathematical notation, special characters)
- Hyphen handling (word continuation)
- Email and affiliation grouping

⚠️ **Minor Differences:**
- Line count: 277 vs 365 (Transmutation is more compact)
- Some paragraph breaks are more aggressive
- Author order may vary (based on PDF extraction)
